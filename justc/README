Decoding

As in the slightly egocentric noisy channel model of machine translation, decoding is the process of recovering a message transmitted through a noisy channel. This was accomplished in a previous assignment with monotone stack decoding and beam search.

Getting Started

Under this directory, we have provided you with a simple decoder written in Python (2.7). You can also find the relevant Spanish sentences and rules for decoding in the *data* directory. Run the decoder using this command:

decode > output

This loads the rules and input sentences, deduces translations, and outputs them into the output file. To evaluate your output, the command:

grade < output

This calculates the sum of each sentence's word error rate with respect to the reference translations produced by Joshua.

The Challenge

Rather than ignoring the hierarchical structure of language and flattening the sentences, taking into account the syntactic information should theoretically allow for, in the case of Hiero-like rules with syntactic nonterminals, decent performance with a relatively small training corpus. With decoding by parsing, you must construct a deductive proof whose goal is a possible translation. You have been given a default implementation of a rudimentary decoder that uses only terminal rules to decode. Your job is to improve upon this decoder and implement a variant of the CKY parsing algorithm for SCFGs.

- Incorporate features for ranking
- Play with pruning parameters
- Add LM integration or hypergraph search [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.111.135]
- Use semiring parsing [http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J99/J99-4004.pdf]
- Try a different type of grammar [http://www.isi.edu/~chiang/papers/synchtut.pdf]
- Try a Hiero-style grammar
- Generate rules with a larger set of data and prune
