The siblings became more enthusiastic about the idea of choosing acting as a profession , and eventually relocated to California with their mother .
Duff 's father stayed at the family home in Houston to take care of their business .
After several years of auditions and meetings , the Duff sisters were cast in various television commercials .
Career
Early work
Duff 's early career was marked by playing minor roles , starting off with an uncredited appearance in Hallmark Entertainment 's western miniseries True Women in 1997 .
She also served as an uncredited extra , in writer-director Willard Carroll 's ensemble dramedy Playing by Heart in 1998 .
Her first major role was as a star of the 1998 film Casper Meets Wendy , a direct-to-video sequel to Casper in which she plays the young witch Wendy , who encounters the animated character Casper .
The film was released to mostly unenthusiastic reviews .
In 1999 , Duff appeared in a supporting role in the television film The Soul Collector , which was based on a Kathleen Kane novel .
Duff won a Young Artist Award for `` Best Performance in a TV Movie or Pilot -LRB- Supporting Young Actress -RRB- '' for her role in the movie .
Duff 's first serious rise to fame came when she was cast as one of the children in the pilot episode of the NBC sitcom Daddio in 2000 .
Her co-star Michael Chiklis , stated , `` After working with her the first day , I remember saying to my wife , ` this young girl is going to be a movie star ' .
She was completely at ease with herself and comfortable in her own skin . ''
Duff was dropped from the cast of Daddio before it being aired , which made her reluctant to pursue her acting career further .
However , her manager and mother urged her on , and a week later she successfully auditioned for the children 's television series Lizzie McGuire , where she portrayed the title role of a clumsy but an average middle school girl .
The show focused on her growth into teenhood .
2001–2003
Lizzie McGuire , which first aired on the Disney Channel on January 12 , 2001 , was a ratings hit , drawing in 2.3 million viewers per episode .
Her participation in the show led to her becoming highly popular among children between the ages of seven and fourteen , with critic Richard Huff of the New York Daily News calling her `` a 2002 version of Annette Funicello `` .
After Duff fulfilled her 65 episode contract with Lizzie McGuire , Disney considered continuing the franchise further , through films and a prime-time television series to be broadcast on ABC .
However , the plans failed because Duff 's representatives said she was not being paid enough for the proposed series .
Duff also starred in the Disney Channel television film Cadet Kelly -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , which became the network 's most watched program in its 19-year history .
In the movie , she plays a free-spirited girl who enrolls in a military school and finds it hard to adjust to its strict and disciplined environment .
Duff 's first role in a theatrical motion picture was in Human Nature -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , an independent film shot around the time of the start of Lizzie McGuire .
It was first showcased at the Cannes and Sundance film festivals .
The film , written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry , follows a female naturalist , played by Patricia Arquette .

Accompanied by the Disney Channel-only single `` Tell Me a Story -LRB- About the Night Before -RRB- `` , it peaked at 154 on the U.S. Billboard 200 album chart and was certified gold .
The track `` Santa Claus Lane `` was included on the soundtrack to The Santa Clause 2 and the single , `` What Christmas Should Be '' , was used in Cheaper by the Dozen .
Duff sang several tracks for soundtrack to The Lizzie McGuire Movie , which included `` I Can't Wait `` and `` Why Not `` , the latter peaking at # 14 in Australia .
The soundtrack to The Lizzie McGuire Movie went platinum in 2003 .
In 2003 , Duff received her first major role in a feature film when she was cast alongside Frankie Muniz in Agent Cody Banks .
The film received positive reviews and was successful enough to spawn a sequel , in which Duff did not participate .
The same year , Duff reprised her role as Lizzie McGuire for The Lizzie McGuire Movie , which exceeded box office expectations , earning $ 42.6 million at the US box office and $ 55 million worldwide .
It received mixed reviews , with certain critics calling it `` an unabashed promotion of Duff’s image , just as Crossroads was for Spears '' , while other reviews were generally positive and encouraging .
Later that year , Duff played one of the 12 children of Steve Martin and Bonnie Hunt in the family film Cheaper by the Dozen , which remains her highest grossing film to date .
She reprised her role in the sequel to the film called Cheaper by the Dozen 2 -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , which failed to be as successful as the original film and was panned by critics .
Duff 's first full-length studio album , Metamorphosis -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , reached number one on the U.S. and Canadian charts and had sold over 3.7 million copies by May 2005 .
The lead single , `` So Yesterday `` -LRB- co-written and produced by The Matrix -RRB- , was a top ten hit in several countries , its follow-up , the Laguna Beach theme song `` Come Clean `` , became Duff 's first top forty U.S. hit and reached the top twenty in UK , Australia and New Zealand .
The video was nominated in the category of Best Pop Video at the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards .

Duff and her sister recorded a cover of The Go-Gos ` `` Our Lips Are Sealed `` for the soundtrack to A Cinderella Story , which also included two other songs by Duff .

Duff 's second full-length album was the self-titled Hilary Duff in which she co-wrote some songs .
She described the album as more `` personal '' and having a `` rock feel '' than Metamorphosis .

The album sold over 1.5 million copies in the U.S. in eight months , but its only U.S. single , `` Fly `` , failed to chart on the Hot 100. ``
Fly '' reached the top forty in Australia , where the album produced a second top forty single , `` Someone 's Watching over Me `` , which was the theme song of the film Raise Your Voice .
Duff contributed the song `` -LRB- I'll Give -RRB- Anything but Up ! '' for the 2004 album Marlo Thomas & Friends : Thanks & Giving All Year Long -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
In 2004 , Duff starred in the romantic comedy A Cinderella Story .
Though the reviews were mostly negative , the film went on to become a moderate box office hit , and critics were impressed by Duff 's performance .
A Cinderella Story earned $ 70,067,909 worldwide and was a commercial success .
Later that year , she starred in the film Raise Your Voice , her first role in a drama film .
While some critics praised Duff for appearing in a more mature and serious role than her previous films , the film itself was heavily panned .
Several reviews were indifferent towards her acting performance and were particularly harsh towards Duff 's vocals , with critics pointing out what appeared to be her digitally enhanced voice .
The film received a lukewarm response at the box office , and is Duff 's least successful film commercially , with total theater receipts of $ 14 million .
The same year , Duff received her first Razzie nomination for worst actress for her roles in Raise Your Voice and A Cinderella Story .
In 2005 , Duff starred in The Perfect Man in which she played the eldest daughter of a divorced woman -LRB- Heather Locklear -RRB- .

In the same year , Duff was again nominated for a Razzie Award , for The Perfect Man and Cheaper by the Dozen 2 .
The 2006 satirical comedy Material Girls , in which she co-starred with her sister Haylie , was also not well received by critics , grossing only $ 16,907,561 worldwide .
The film , directed by Martha Coolidge and co-produced by Madonna 's independent film production company Maverick Entertainment , starred the Duff sisters as wealthy siblings who must fight to reclaim their fortune following a scandal .
Duff along with her sister Haylie , received two more nominations for Razzie awards for their role in the film .
Duff 's third album , Most Wanted -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , comprised her favorite tracks from her previous two albums , remixes , and new songs inspired by pop-rock musicians such as The Killers and Muse .
In an appearance on Total Request Live , Duff stated that it was not a greatest hits album , but that her label told her it was time to release a new album .
She had more creative control over Most Wanted compared to her previous releases , co-writing the new material with producers Joel Madden and his brother , Benji , both members of Good Charlotte .
The lead single , `` Wake Up `` , became Duff 's highest peaking single on the U.S. Hot 100 at the time , and its video received heavy rotation on MTV .
The video for the second single , `` Beat of My Heart `` , was also popular , but the single itself did not chart in the U.S .

By 2005 , Duff appeared to have lost weight , leading the media to speculate that she had developed an eating disorder , though Duff denied this claim .
Duff was interviewed on the Australian current affair show Today Tonight and stated that she lost weight by leading a more active lifestyle .
Later in 2006 , an article on Digital Spy stated that Duff had slimmed down to a U.S. size zero because of media reports suggesting she had gained fifteen pounds .
She later stated that she had been feeling the pressure to be thin , because she is perceived in the media to be either too fat or too thin .
Duff called this `` judgmental '' and `` mean '' .
In June 2006 , when asked about her then-boyfriend Joel Madden , a native of Waldorf , Maryland , in an interview with Elle , Duff replied , `` He 's very real , like , he 's from a pretty ghetto place in Maryland ...
I like that '' .
Duff 's `` ghetto '' comments sparked a mixture of mild offense and bemusement from residents of the Waldorf area , as the suburban , mostly middle-class town did not fall into the traditional impoverished inner city concept of a ghetto .
Duff later claimed she was referring not to Waldorf , but actually a section of Baltimore where Madden lived briefly as a young adult .
In late 2006 Duff took legal action against an alleged stalker and his roommate .
On November 3 , 2006 , Duff 's stalker , Maksim Miakovsky , was arrested for threatening to kill her .
He was booked on charges of making criminal threats and stalking .
According to legal papers filed by Duff , Miakovsky came to the U.S. `` for the sole purpose of meeting and becoming romantically involved with Ms. Duff '' .
Miakovsky was being held on $ 200,000 bail at the Manhattan Beach jail .
He was arraigned on November 7 , 2006 .
On January 19 , 2007 , Miakovsky was sentenced to 117 days in jail and five years probation after pleading no contest to the charges .

Dardanelles
The Dardanelles , a long narrow strait dividing the Balkans -LRB- Europe -RRB- along the Gallipoli peninsula from Asia Minor .
A map depicting the location of the Dardanelles -LRB- yellow -RRB- relative to the Bosporus and the Sea of Marmara .
Location of the Dardanelles is boxed in red .
The Dardanelles -LRB- , -RRB- , formerly known as the Hellespont -LRB- Greek : Ελλήσποντος , Hellespontos -RRB- , is a narrow strait in northwestern Turkey connecting the Aegean Sea to the Sea of Marmara .
It is one of the Turkish Straits , along with its counterpart the Bosporus .
It is located at approximately .
The strait is 61 kilometers -LRB- 38 mi -RRB- long but only 1.2 to 6 kilometers -LRB- 0.75 to 4 mi -RRB- wide , averaging 55 meters -LRB- 180 ft -RRB- deep with a maximum depth of 82 meters -LRB- 300 ft -RRB- .
Water flows in both directions along the strait , from the Sea of Marmara to the Aegean via a surface current and in the opposite direction via an undercurrent .
Like the Bosporus , it separates Europe -LRB- in this case the Gallipoli peninsula -RRB- and the mainland of Asia .
The strait is an International waterway , and together with the Bosporus , Dardanelles connects the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea .
The Turkish name Çanakkale Boğazı is derived from the major city adjoining the strait , Çanakkale -LRB- which takes its name from its famous castles ; kale means `` castle '' -RRB- .
The name Dardanelles derives from Dardania , an ancient land on the Asian shore of the strait .
History
The Dardanelles as seen from space .
The strait has long had a strategic role in history .
The ancient city of Troy was located near the western entrance of the strait and the strait 's Asiatic shore was the focus of the Trojan War .
It was also the scene of the legendary Greek story of Hero and Leander .
The Persian army of Xerxes I and later the Greek army of Alexander the Great crossed the Dardanelles in opposite directions to invade each other 's lands , in 480 BC and 334 BC respectively .
The Dardanelles were vital to the defense of Constantinople during the Byzantine period , and since the 14th century they have almost continuously been controlled by the Turks .
Historic map of Dardanelles by Piri Reis .
Gaining control or special access to the strait became a key foreign policy goal of the Russian Empire during the 19th century .
During the Napoleonic Wars , Russia—supported by Great Britain in the Dardanelles Operation — blockaded the straits in 1807 .
Following the Ottoman Empire ` s defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828-1829 , in 1833 Russia pressured Turkey to sign the Treaty of Hunkiar Iskelesi —which required the straits to be closed to warships of non-Black Sea powers at Russia 's request .
That would have effectively given Russia a free hand in the Black Sea .
That treaty alarmed the losers , who were concerned that the consequences of potential Russian expansionism in the Black Sea and Mediterranean regions could conflict with their own possessions and economic interest in the regions .
At the London Straits Convention in July 1841 , the United Kingdom , France , Austria , and Prussia pressured Russia to agree that only Turkish warships could traverse the Dardanelles in peacetime .
The United Kingdom and France subsequently sent their fleets through the straits to attack Crimea during the Crimean War in 1853—but this was done as allies of the Ottoman Empire .
That convention was formally reaffirmed by the Congress of Paris in 1856 , following the Russian defeat in the Crimean War .
It remained technically in force into the 20th and 21st centuries .
Dardanelles ' view from a ship .
In 1915 , the western Allies sent a massive invasion force of British , Indian , Australian , and New Zealander troops to attempt to open up the strait .
At the battle of Gallipoli , Turkish troops trapped the Allies on the beaches of the Gallipoli peninsula .
The Battle of Gallipoli did damage the career of Sir Winston Churchill , then the First Lord of the Admiralty , who eagerly promoted the use of Royal Navy sea power to force open the straits .
The straits were mined by the Turks to prevent Allied ships from penetrating them , but in minor actions , two submarines , one British and one Australian , did succeed in penetrating the minefields .
The British one sunk an obsolete Turkish pre-dreadnought battleship off the Golden Horn of Istanbul .
Sir Ian Hamilton ` s Mediterranean Expeditionary Force was unsuccessful in its attempt to capture the Gallipoli peninsula , and its withdrawal was ordered in January 1916 , after 10 months fighting and more than 200,000 casualties .
Following the war , the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres demilitarized the strait and made it an international territory under the control of the League of Nations .
This was amended under the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne which restored the straits to Turkey but allowed all foreign warships to traverse the straits freely .
Turkey rejected the terms of this treaty and subsequently remilitarized the area .
The reversion to this old regime was formalized under the Montreux Convention of July 1936 .
The convention , which is still technically in force today , treats the straits as an international shipping lane , but Turkey retains the right to restrict the naval traffic of non- Black Sea nations -LRB- like Greece , a traditional enemy , or Algeria -RRB- .
During World War II , through February 1945 , when Turkey was neutral for most of the length of the conflict , the Dardanelles were closed to the ships of the belligerent nations .
Turkey declared war on Germany in February 1945 , but it did not employ any offensive forces in that war .
Trivia
The Australian indie rock band Dardanelles is named after the region .
The University of Washington fight song Bow Down to Washington includes the lyrics `` It 's harder to push them over the line than pass the Dardanelles . ''
The Dardanelles is mentioned in the opening song of the musical Sweeney Todd , the Demon Barber of Fleet Street , and in the 2007 film adaptation .
In the song `` No Place Like London '' , the character Anthony Hope sings ,
I have sailed the world , beheld its wonders
From the Dardanelles to the mountains of Peru .
The strait was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 100 lira banknote of 1938-1942 .

S.C. Beira-Mar
Sport Clube Beira-Mar -LRB- pron. -RRB- is a Portuguese sports club from Aveiro .
Its football team is in Liga Vitalis
Beira-Mar plays in a football stadium built for the 2004 European Football Championship called Estádio Municipal de Aveiro .
Its best known players of all times were Eusébio -LRB- who played for the team during the 1976/77 season -RRB- and António Sousa .
Both tasted glory with Portugal national football team .
History
Sport Beira-Mar was founded on 1 January 1922 in Aveiro .
Beira-Mar is most known for its renowned futsal , basketball , and boxing departments .
Football is also a growing spot in the club , with the club being a regular participant in the highest division of Portuguese football , nowadays called BWINLIGA .
Beira-Mar 's best season in the league was in 1990/91 .
The biggest feat in the club 's history was winning the Portuguese Football Cup in the 1998/99 season , and achieving its final in 1990/91 .
The club also won the Taça Ribeiro dos Reis in 1964/65 and won the 2nd Division , three times , in 1960/61 ; 1964/65 ; 1970/71 .
The club also won the Liga de Honra in 2005/06 .
Beira Mar participated in the UEFA Cup in the 1999/2000 season being beaten by Vitesse of Holland 2-1 .
Back in the 1960s , Eusébio was an icon to Portugal and Benfica fans .
But in 1976 , many Beira-Mar fans were skeptical if Eusébio could still play the way he did 10 years prior , they soon found out as Eusébio soon registered 3 goals in 12 games a feat for a player his age .
Without a doubt , the biggest feat in Beira-Mar 's history was the Portuguese Football Cup in the 1998/99 season , when the team was managed by António Sousa , a former player of the club , who also played for Porto and the national squad .
The lone goal in the final against Campomaiorense was scored by Ricardo Sousa , his son .
Unfortunately , the club was relegated to the Liga de Honra that same year .
This was the second time the club reached the competition final , the first one was in 1990/91 , when it lost to Porto .
Estádio Municipal de Aveiro is a football -LRB- soccer -RRB- stadium in Aveiro , Portugal .
It was designed for UEFA Euro 2004 by the architect Tomás Taveira .
It is very colorful and festive-looking .
It seats 30,498 people and is the home to the football club of Beira-Mar .
Many Beira-Mar fans call it the `` Circus '' for its ' intense design .
The question of who actually owns the stadium , the club or the municipality of Aveiro , has caused many tensions between the two entities , endangering the funding of the club .
The return of Mário Jardel to Portugal to play in Beira-Mar was one of the biggest news in the Portuguese football in the summer of 2006 .
It lifted many of Beira-Mar 's fans hopes that the club would not get relegated with the Brazilian scorer , who won the European boot on several occasions -LRB- which is given to the top scorer in Europe -RRB- .
He scored in his debut game , a 2-2 draw against Desportivo das Aves .
However , with Beira-Mar struggling in the Liga , Jardel transferred to Anorthosis Famagusta of Cyprus in the winter transfer window .
The fans of Beira-Mar are known as Auri-Negros -LRB- Yellow-Blacks -RRB- .

Spartacus
Spartacus by Denis Foyatier , 1830
Spartacus -LRB- c. 109 BC-71 BC -RRB- , according to Roman historians , was a slave and a gladiator who became a leader -LRB- or possibly one of several leaders -RRB- in the somewhat successful slave uprising against the Roman Republic known as the Third Servile War .
Little is known about Spartacus beyond the events of the war , and surviving historical accounts are inaccurate and often contradictory .
Spartacus 's struggle , often seen as the fight of an oppressed people fighting for their freedom against a slave-owning aristocracy , has found new meaning for modern writers since the 19th century .
The rebellion of Spartacus has proven inspirational to many modern literary and political writers , making Spartacus a folk hero among cultures both ancient and modern .
Spartacus 's origins
Thracian tribes in Odrysian kingdom and Spartacus tribe , the Maedi
The ancient sources agree on Spartacus 's origins .
Plutarch describes him as `` a Thracian of Nomadic stock '' .
Appian says he was `` a Thracian by birth , who had once served as a soldier with the Romans , but had since been a prisoner and sold for a Gladiator `` .
Florus -LRB- 2.8.8 -RRB- described him as one `` who from Thracian mercenary , had become a Roman soldier , of a soldier a deserter and robber , and afterwards , from consideration of his strength , a gladiator '' .
Some authors refer to the Thracian tribe of the Maedi , which in historic times occupied the area on the southwestern fringes of Thrace -LRB- present-day south-western Bulgaria -RRB- .
There is a hypothesis , he was born in the Thracian settlement Desudava , in the area of present-day Sandanski , where his monument is built .
Plutarch also writes that Spartacus 's wife , a prophetess of the same tribe , was enslaved with him .
The name Spartacus is otherwise attested in the Black Sea region : kings of the Thracian dynasty of the Cimmerian Bosporus and Pontus are known to have borne it , and a Thracian `` Spardacus '' or `` Sparadokos '' , father of Seuthes I of the Odrysae , is also known .
Third Servile War
Revolt leading to the Third Servile War
Spartacus was trained at the gladiatorial school -LRB- ludus -RRB- near Capua , belonging to Lentulus Batiatus .
Finally in 73 BC , Spartacus and some seventy followers escaped from the gladiator school of Lentulus Batiatus .
Seizing the knives in the cook 's shop and a wagon full of weapons , the slaves fled to the caldera of Mount Vesuvius , near modern day Naples .
There they were joined by other rural slaves .
The group overran the region , plundering and pillaging .
Spartacus 's intention was to leave Italy and return home .
His chief aides were gladiators from Gaul and Germania , named Crixus , Castus , Gannicus and Oenomaus .
Other runaway slaves joined , increasing the numbers to several hundred .
While the slave-to-Roman citizen ratio at that time was very high , a larger problem was that at the time of the uprising Pompey was fighting a revolt led by Quintus Sertorius in Hispania while at the same time the consul Lucullus had committed the rest of Rome 's available legions to fighting Mithridates in the Third Mithridatic War .
While the dispersal of Romes legions on two distant fronts made this slave rebellion a very serious threat , Rome failed to take adequate action .
With Rome 's experienced legions away , and believing slaves could not defeat their legions , the Senate sent a praetor , Claudius Glaber -LRB- his nomen may have been Clodius ; his praenomen is unknown -RRB- , against the rebels , with a militia of about 3,000 .
They besieged the rebels on Vesuvius blocking their escape , but Spartacus had ropes made from vines and with his men , climbed down a cliff on the other side of the volcano , to the rear of the Roman soldiers , and staged a surprise attack .
Not expecting trouble from a handful of slaves , the Romans had not fortified their camp or posted adequate sentries .
As a result , most of the Roman soldiers were still sleeping and killed in this attack .
After this success many runaway slaves joined Spartacus until the group grew into an army of allegedly 1,000,000 escaped slaves .
Military success continues
The Fall of Spartacus .
Spartacus is credited as an excellent military tactician and his experience as a former auxiliary soldier made him a formidable enemy , but his men were mostly former slave labourers who lacked military training .
They hid out in the Caldera on Mount Vesuvius which at that time was dormant and heavily wooded , and this enabled them to train properly for the fight with the Romans .
Following the defeat of Glaber , two legions of militia under the command of the praetor Publius Varinius set out to confront the rebels .
Spartacus intercepted an advance force of 2,000 men under Varinius’ lieutenant Lucius Furius and annihilated it .
Leaving Vesuvius he discovered another force of Romans under Cossinius at a camp near Herculaneum which was similarly defeated .
Moving further south into Lucania the rebels deployed in battle formation to face the 4,000 legionairies led by Varinius .
Some legionaires refused to advance , while others fled but Varinius attacked and was badly defeated , Varinius escaped but the legions standards and insignia were lost .
Four hundred Roman prisoners were forced to fight each other as gladiators or were crucified in celebration .
By spring the rebels marched turned north towards Gaul occupying Campania and destroying a Roman corps under Gaius Thoranius .
Spartacus wanted to continue north but Crixus wanted to attack Rome and taking 30,000 men with him moved to the Apulia region .
Finally taking the revolt seriously , the consuls Lucius Gellius Publicola and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus Clodianus led four veteran Roman legions who had been recalled from Spain , Gaul and Germany to crush the rebellion .
Lentulus blocked Spartacus in the north while two legions under praetor Quintus Arrius attacked Crixus near Apulia , soundly defeating the rebels and killing Crixus .
The two legions then moved behind Spartacus intending to trap him between the two armies .
Spartacus attacked Lentulus destroying his army , he then turned and defeated the oncoming legions of Gellius .
At Mutina in the Cisalpine Gaul region of northern Italy governor Caius Cassius attempted to block the rebels with 10,000 men but was quickly defeated leaving no more obstacles between Spartacus and Gaul .
More importantly , no more legions were available to defend Rome .
Choice to remain in Italy
Apparently , Spartacus had intended to march his army out of Italy and into Gaul -LRB- now Belgium , Switzerland and France -RRB- or maybe even to Hispania , where Roman soldiers were fighting , to join the rebellion of Quintus Sertorius as it is known that Sertorius was in communication with the rebels .
However , he changed his mind and turned back south , the sources say under pressure from his followers for they wanted more plunder .
Although it is not known for certain why they turned back when they were on the brink of escaping into Gaul , it is regarded as their greatest mistake .
There are theories that some of the non-fighting followers -LRB- some 10,000 or so -RRB- did in fact cross the Alps and return to their homelands .
The Roman senate gave supreme military command to the praetor Marcus Licinius Crassus who at that time was the wealthiest man in Rome and was also the only volunteer for the position .
Crassus now collected the remnants of the defeated legions and integrated them with several legions newly raised from militia .
When news reached Rome that Spartacus was marching through Picenum Crassus ordered his legate Mummius to lead two of the new legions behind Spartacus but to avoid contact .
Mummius , believing he had the element of surprise on his side , attacked .
In the resulting battle the legions broke rank and fled .
Crassus ordered that 500 legionaires accused of cowardice be decimated -LRB- one in ten executed after drawing lots -RRB- and began re-arming and training the troops .
Finally , with 40,000 men in eight legions now under his command , Crassus engaged Spartacus in a running battle forcing him further south through Lucania as Crassus gained the upper hand .
By the end of 72 BC , Spartacus was encamped in Rhegium -LRB- Reggio Calabria -RRB- , near the Strait of Messina .
Spartacus arranged a deal with Cilician pirates to get them to Sicily but after accepting payment they failed to take their fleet to the approved rendezvous .
Crassus now constructed a 32 mile long wood and stone wall with a 15 foot deep ditch completely across the peninsula to cut the rebels off and starve them into submission .
With winter setting in and supplies running low Spartacus had no choice but to try to break through the encirclement .
During a snowstorm he managed to break through Crassus 's lines and escape towards Brundisium -LRB- now Brindisi -RRB- .
With the rebels now free again Rome panicked and the senate authorized the return of Pompey from Hispania ; and Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus from Macedonia .
Ganicus and Cestus with their followers broke away from Spartacus ' army to plunder the villages and estates but were surprised by Crassus .
Camped on the shores of a lake with no retreat possible more than 12,000 were killed before Spartacus arrived to rescue them .
Pursued by the Romans , the rebels fled to the mountains of Petelia .
With several legions under the legates Scrophas and Quintus attacking their rear Spartacus wheeled about and routed them .
Word arrived that Lucullus had landed at Brundisium and Spartacus decided to attack Crassus as the weaker of the two forces .
Crassus ' forces faced Spartacus in Lucania near the river Silarus , where Spartacus sought to overwhelm the Romans by sheer numbers .
The rebels were routed with the survivors fleeing .
It is believed that Spartacus himself was killed during the rout .
According to Plutarch , `` Finally , after his companions had taken to flight , he -LRB- Spartacus -RRB- stood alone , surrounded by a multitude of foes , and was still defending himself when he was cut down '' .
According to Appian , `` Spartacus was wounded in the thigh with a spear and sank upon his knee , holding his shield in front of him and contending in this way against his assailants until he and the great mass of those with him were surrounded and slain '' ; The body of Spartacus was not found .
After the battle , legionaries found and rescued 3,000 unharmed Roman prisoners in their camp and 6,600 of Spartacus 's followers were crucified along the via Appia -LRB- or the Appian Way -RRB- from Brundisium to Rome .
Crassus never gave orders for the bodies to be taken down , thus travelers were forced to see the bodies for years after the final battle .
Around 5,000 slaves , however , escaped the capture .
Although Crassus had won , his own legions were so badly depleted in the battle that he was unable to chase the fugitives slaves who had escaped .
They fled north and were later destroyed by Pompey , who had arrived from Roman Iberia and hunted the rebels without mercy throughout Italy .
This enabled him also to claim credit for ending this war .
Pompey was greeted as a hero in Rome while Crassus received little credit or celebration .

Shimane Prefecture
is a prefecture of Japan located in the Chūgoku region on Honshū island .
The capital is Matsue .
It is the second least populous prefecture in Japan , next to the Tottori Prefecture that is a neighboring prefecture on the east side .
The prefecture has an area elongated from east to west facing the Chūgoku Mountain Range on the south side and to the Sea of Japan on the north side .
Most of the cities are near the shoreline of the Sea of Japan .
There is Izumo Taisha in Izumo City , which is one of the oldest Shinto shrines in Japan .
The Oki Islands in the Sea of Japan are also part of Shimane Prefecture , which also claims to have jurisdiction over the South Korea -controlled island of Liancourt Rocks -LRB- Takeshima -RRB- .
History
Matsue Castle
Early History
The history of Shimane starts with the Japanese mythology .
Shinto god Ōkuninushi was believed to be living in Izumo , an old province in Shimane .
The Izumo Shrine , which is in the city of Izumo , honors the god .
At that time , the current Shimane prefecture was divided in to 3 parts , Iwami , Izumo , and Oki .
That lasted until the abolition of the han system took place in 1871 .
During the Nara period , Kakinomoto no Hitomaro read a poem on Shimane 's nature when he was sent as the Royal governor .
Later on in the Kamakura period , Kamakura Shogunate forces emperors Gotoba and Emperor Godaigo to exile to Oki .
Emperor Godaigo later gets away from Oki and begins rallying against the shogunate , which later succeeds .
Middle Ages
During the Muromachi period , Izumo and Oki were controlled by the Kyogoku clan .
However , after the Ōnin War , the Amago clan expanded power based in Gassan-Toda castle .
However , in 1566 Mori Motonari conquered Izumo , Iwami , and Oki .
After over 30 years of Mori control , in 1600 Horio Yoshiharu enters Izumo and Oki as the result of Battle of Sekigahara which Mori lost .
Following the change , Horio Yoshiharu decides to move to build Matsue Castle instead of Gassan-Toda , and soon after Yoshiharu 's death the castle is completed .
Later in 1638 , the grandson of Tokugawa Ieyasu , Matsudaira Naomasa enters the castle since the Horio clan had no heir , and his family ruled until the abolition of the han system .
The Iwami area was split in to 3 clans : The mining district -LRB- direct control of the Shogunate -RRB- , the Hamada clan and the Tsuwano clan .
The Iwami Ginzan , now a UNESCO World Heritage Site produced silver and was one of the nation 's largest silver mine by the early 17th century .
Hamada clan was on the shogunate 's side in the Meiji Restoration , and the castle was burned down .
The Tsuwano clan , despite the Matsudaira -LRB- relative of the shogun -RRB- rule was on the emperor 's side in the restoration .
Modern times
In 1871 , abolition of the han system places the old Shimane and Hamada provinces in the current area of Shimane Prefecture .
Later that year , Oki becomes part of Tottori .
In 1876 , Hamada Prefecture merges with Shimane and is named Shimane Prefecture .
Also , Tottori Prefecture merges in the same year .
However , five years later , in 1881 , the current portion of Tottori Prefecture separates and the current border is formed .
Geography
Map of Shimane Prefecture .
Shimane prefecture is situated on the Sea of Japan side of the Chugoku region .
Because of its mountainous landscape , rice farming is done mostly in the Izumo plain where the city of Izumo is located .
Another major landform is the Shimane peninsula .
The peninsula is located across on the Sea of Japan from Izumo to Sakaiminato , which apparently is located in Tottori prefecture .
Also , the peninsula created two sea water lakes Lake Shinji and Nakaumi .
The island of Daikon is located in Nakaumi .
Off from the island of Honshū , the island of Oki is in Shimane prefecture as well .
The island itself is in the Daisen-Oki National Park .
Shimane also claims the use of Liancourt Rocks , which they are in dispute with South Korea .
Most major cities are located either on the seaside , or along a river .
Between 2004 and 2005 , municipalities across Japan merged , and Shimane prefecture was not an exception .
For the list of mergers , see List of mergers in Shimane Prefecture .
Cities
Eight cities are located in Shimane Prefecture , the largest being Matsue , the capital , and the smallest being Gotsu .
The cities Masuda , Unnan , Yasugi , and Gotsu had a slight population increase due to the mergers in the early 2000s .

Mergers
Climate
The prefecture has a sub-tropical climate .
Winter is cloudy with a little snow and summer is a little humid .
The year average for temperature is 14.6 degrees Celsius .
During the rainy season , June to around Mid July , it rains every day .
The hottest average temperature is in August with 26.3 degrees Celsius .
The average year preciparation is 1799 millimeters , compared to Tokyo ` s 1467 mm and Obihiro with 920 mm .
Transportation
Airports
Izumo Airport terminal
Three airports serve Shimane .
The Izumo Airport located in Hikawa is the largest airport in the prefecture in terms of passengers , which has regular flights to Haneda Airport , Osaka Airport , Fukuoka Airport , and Oki Airport .
The Iwami Airport has two flights each day to Haneda and Osaka and 2 arrivals .
Oki Airport has scheduled flights to Osaka and Izumo Airports .

In Shimane , the largest employer is the retailing industry , employing over 60,000 workers .
Mishimaya and Juntendo are examples of companies .
The manufacturing industry has the second number of employees with 49,000 workers .
In the number of business locations , the retailing industry is first with over 12,000 .
Twenty-nine percent of the total industry income is from the service industry , including retailers .

Demographics
One-third of the prefecture 's population is concentrated in the Izumo-Matsue area .
Otherwise , over two-thirds of the population is on the coastline .
The reason is that the Chugoku mountains make the land inland harder to inhabit .
Also , Shimane has the largest percentage of the elderly , and the capital Matsue has the smallest population out of all the 47 prefectural capitals .

Stonehenge
Stonehenge is a prehistoric monument located in the English county of Wiltshire , about west of Amesbury and north of Salisbury .
One of the most famous sites in the world , Stonehenge is composed of earthworks surrounding a circular setting of large standing stones and sits at the centre of the densest complex of Neolithic and Bronze Age monuments in England , including several hundred burial mounds .
Archaeologists had believed that the iconic stone monument was erected around 2500 BC , as described in the chronology below .
However one recent theory has suggested that the first stones were not erected until 2400-2200 BC , whilst another suggests that bluestones may have been erected at the site as early as 3000 BC -LRB- see phase 1 below -RRB- .
The surrounding circular earth bank and ditch , which constitute the earliest phase of the monument , have been dated to about 3100 BC .
The site and its surroundings were added to the UNESCO ` s list of World Heritage Sites in 1986 in a co-listing with Avebury henge monument , and it is also a legally protected Scheduled Ancient Monument .
Stonehenge itself is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage while the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust .
New archaeological evidence found by the Stonehenge Riverside Project indicates that Stonehenge served as a burial ground from its earliest beginnings .
The dating of cremated remains found that burials took place as early as 3000 BC , when the first ditches were being built around the monument .
Burials continued at Stonehenge for at least another 500 years when the giant stones which mark the landmark were put up .
According to Professor Mike Parker Pearson , head of Stonehenge Riverside Project :
Etymology
Christopher Chippindale ` s Stonehenge Complete gives the derivation of the name Stonehenge as coming from the Old English words `` stān '' meaning `` stone '' , and either `` hencg '' meaning `` hinge `` -LRB- because the stone lintels hinge on the upright stones -RRB- or `` hen -LRB- c -RRB- en '' meaning `` hang `` or `` gallows `` or `` instrument of torture '' .
Medieval gallows consisted of two uprights with a lintel joining them , resembling Stonehenge 's trilithons , rather than looking like the inverted L-shape more familiar today .
The `` henge '' portion has given its name to a class of monuments known as henges .
Archaeologists define henges as earthworks consisting of a circular banked enclosure with an internal ditch .
As often happens in archaeological terminology , this is a holdover from antiquarian usage , and Stonehenge is not truly a henge site as its bank is inside its ditch .
Despite being contemporary with true Neolithic henges and stone circles , Stonehenge is in many ways atypical .
For example , its extant trilithons make it unique .
Stonehenge is only distantly related to the other stone circles in the British Isles , such as the Ring of Brodgar .
History
Plan of Stonehenge today .
After Cleal et al. and Pitts .
Italicised numbers in the text refer to the labels on this plan .
Stonehenge itself evolved in several construction phases spanning at least some 1500 years .
However there is evidence of large scale construction both before and afterwards on and around the monument that perhaps extends the landscape 's time frame to 6500 years .
Dating and understanding the various phases of activity at Stonehenge is not a simple task ; it is complicated by poorly kept early excavation records , surprisingly few accurate scientific dates and the disturbance of the natural chalk by periglacial effects and animal burrowing .
The modern phasing most generally agreed by archaeologists is detailed below .
Features mentioned in the text are numbered and shown on the plan , right , which illustrates the site as of 2004 .
The plan omits the trilithon lintels for clarity .
Holes that no longer , or never , contained stones are shown as open circles and stones visible today are shown coloured .
It is widely assumed that Stonehenge once stood as a magnificent `` complete '' monument ; we should be aware that this can not be proved , since around half of the stones that should be present are in fact missing , and since many of the assumed stone sockets have never actually been recorded through excavation .
Before the monument -LRB- 8000 BC forward -RRB-
Some archaeologists have found four -LRB- or possibly five , although one may have been a natural tree throw -RRB- large Mesolithic postholes which date to around 8000 BC nearby , beneath the modern tourist car-park .
These held pine posts around in diameter which were erected and left to rot in situ .
Three of the posts -LRB- and possibly four -RRB- were in an east-west alignment and may have had ritual significance ; no parallels are known from Britain at the time but similar sites have been found in Scandinavia .
At this time , Salisbury Plain was still wooded but four thousand years later , during the earlier Neolithic , a causewayed enclosure at Robin Hood 's Ball and long barrow tombs were built in the surrounding landscape .
In approximately 3500 BC a large cursus monument was built north of the site as the first farmers began to clear the forest and exploit the area .
Stonehenge 1 -LRB- ca. 3100 BC -RRB-
Stonehenge 1 .
After Cleal et al .
The first monument consisted of a circular bank and ditch enclosure made of Late Cretaceous -LRB- Santonian Age -RRB- Seaford Chalk , -LRB- 7 and 8 -RRB- measuring about in diameter with a large entrance to the north east and a smaller one to the south -LRB- 14 -RRB- .
It stood in open grassland on a slightly sloping but not especially remarkable spot .
The builders placed the bones of deer and oxen in the bottom of the ditch as well as some worked flint tools .
The bones were considerably older than the antler picks used to dig the ditch and the people who buried them had looked after them for some time prior to burial .
The ditch itself was continuous but had been dug in sections , like the ditches of the earlier causewayed enclosures in the area .
The chalk dug from the ditch was piled up to form the bank .
This first stage is dated to around 3100 BC after which the ditch began to silt up naturally and was not cleared out by the builders .
Within the outer edge of the enclosed area was dug a circle of 56 pits , each about a metre -LRB- 3'3 '' -RRB- in diameter -LRB- 13 -RRB- , known as the Aubrey holes after John Aubrey , the seventeenth century antiquarian who was thought to have first identified them .
The pits may have contained standing timbers , creating a timber circle although there is no excavated evidence of them .
A recent excavation has suggested that the Aubrey Holes may have originally been used to erect a bluestone circle .
If this were the case it would advance the earliest known stone structure at the monument by some 500 years .
A small outer bank beyond the ditch could also date to this period .
Stonehenge 2 -LRB- ca. 3000 BC -RRB-
Evidence of the second phase is no longer visible .
It appears from the number of postholes dating to this period that some form of timber structure was built within the enclosure during the early 3rd millennium BC .
Further standing timbers were placed at the northeast entrance and a parallel alignment of posts ran inwards from the southern entrance .
The postholes are smaller than the Aubrey Holes , being only around in diameter and are much less regularly spaced .
The bank was purposely reduced in height and the ditch continued to silt up .
At least twenty-five of the Aubrey Holes are known to have contained later , intrusive , cremation burials dating to the two centuries after the monument 's inception .
It seems that whatever the holes ' initial function , it changed to become a funerary one during Phase 2 .
Thirty further cremations were placed in the enclosure 's ditch and at other points within the monument , mostly in the eastern half .
Stonehenge is therefore interpreted as functioning as an enclosed cremation cemetery at this time , the earliest known cremation cemetery in the British Isles .
Fragments of unburnt human bone have also been found in the ditch fill .
Late Neolithic grooved ware pottery has been found in connection with the features from this phase providing dating evidence .
Stonehenge 3 I -LRB- ca. 2600 BC -RRB-
Stonehenge from the heelstone in 2007 with the ` Slaughter Stone ' in the foreground
Archaeological excavation has indicated that around 2600 BC , timber was abandoned in favour of stone , and two concentric arrays of holes -LRB- the Q and R Holes -RRB- were dug in the centre of the site .
These stone sockets are only partly known -LRB- hence on present evidence are sometimes described as forming ‘crescents’ -RRB- , however they could be the remains of a double ring .
Again , there is little firm dating evidence for this phase .
The holes held up to 80 standing stones -LRB- shown blue on the plan -RRB- only 43 of which can be traced today .
The bluestones -LRB- some of which are made of dolerite , an igneous rock -RRB- , were thought for much of the 20th century to have been transported by humans from the Preseli Hills , away in modern day Pembrokeshire in Wales .
A newer theory is that they were brought from glacial deposits much nearer the site , which had been carried down from the northern side of the Preselis to southern England by the Irish Sea Glacier .
Other standing stones may well have been small sarsens , used later as lintels .
The stones , which weighed about four tons , consisted mostly of spotted Ordovician dolerite but included examples of rhyolite , tuff and volcanic and calcareous ash ; in total around 20 different rock types are represented .
Each monolith measures around in height , between 1 m and 1.5 m -LRB- 3.3-4.9 ft -RRB- wide and around thick .
What was to become known as the Altar Stone -LRB- 1 -RRB- , is almost certainly derived from either Carmarthenshire or the Brecon Beacons and may have stood as a single large monolith .
Plan of the central stone structure today .
After Johnson 2008
The north eastern entrance was also widened at this time with the result that it precisely matched the direction of the midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset of the period .
This phase of the monument was abandoned unfinished however , the small standing stones were apparently removed and the Q and R holes purposefully backfilled .
Even so , the monument appears to have eclipsed the site at Avebury in importance towards the end of this phase .
The Heelstone -LRB- 5 -RRB- , a Tertiary sandstone , may also have been erected outside the north eastern entrance during this period although it can not be securely dated and may have been installed at any time in phase 3 .
At first , a second stone , now no longer visible , joined it .
Two , or possibly three , large portal stones were set up just inside the north eastern entrance of which only one , the fallen Slaughter Stone -LRB- 4 -RRB- , long , now remains .
Other features loosely dated to phase 3 include the four Station Stones -LRB- 6 -RRB- , two of which stood atop mounds -LRB- 2 and 3 -RRB- .
The mounds are known as ` barrows ' although they do not contain burials .
Stonehenge Avenue , -LRB- 10 -RRB- , a parallel pair of ditches and banks leading to the River Avon was also added .
Two ditches similar to Heelstone Ditch circling the Heelstone , which was by then reduced to a single monolith , were later dug around the Station Stones .
Stonehenge 3 II -LRB- 2600 BC to 2400 BC -RRB-
The next major phase of activity saw 30 enormous Oligocene - Miocene sarsen stones -LRB- shown grey on the plan -RRB- brought to the site .
They may have come from a quarry around north of Stonehenge , on the Marlborough Downs , or they may have been collected from a `` litter '' of sarsens on the chalk downs , closer to hand .
The stones were dressed and fashioned with mortise and tenon joints before 30 were erected as a diameter circle of standing stones , with a ring of 30 lintel stones resting on top .
The lintels were fitted to one another using another woodworking method , the tongue and groove joint .
Each standing stone was around high , wide and weighed around 25 tons .
Each had clearly been worked with the final effect in mind ; the orthostats widen slightly towards the top in order that their perspective remains constant as they rise up from the ground while the lintel stones curve slightly to continue the circular appearance of the earlier monument .
The sides of the stones that face inwards are smoother and more finely worked than the sides that face outwards .
The average thickness of these stones is and the average distance between them is .
A total of 74 stones would have been needed to complete the circle and unless some of the sarsens were removed from the site , it would seem that the ring was left incomplete .
Of the lintel stones , they are each around , wide and thick .
The tops of the lintels are above the ground .
Within this circle stood five trilithons of dressed sarsen stone arranged in a horseshoe shape across with its open end facing north east .
These huge stones , ten uprights and five lintels , weigh up to 50 tons each and were again linked using complex jointing .
They are arranged symmetrically ; the smallest pair of trilithons were around tall , the next pair a little higher and the largest , single trilithon in the south west corner would have been tall .
Only one upright from the Great Trilithon still stands ; is visible and a further is below ground .
Graffiti on the sarsen stones .
Below are ancient carvings of a dagger and an axe
The images of a ` dagger ' and 14 ` axe-heads ' have been recorded carved on one of the sarsens , known as stone 53 .
Further axe-head carvings have been seen on the outer faces of stones known as numbers 3 , 4 , and 5 .
They are difficult to date but are morphologically similar to later Bronze Age weapons ; recent laser scanning work on the carvings supports this interpretation .
The pair of trilithons in north east are smallest , measuring around in height and the largest is the trilithon in the south west of the horseshoe is almost tall .
This ambitious phase is radiocarbon dated to between 2600 and 2400 BC .
This is slightly before two sets of burials discovered to the west in Amesbury -LRB- the Amesbury Archer found in 2002 , and the Boscombe Bowmen discovered in 2003 -RRB- as well as the Stonehenge Archer whose body was discovered in the outer ditch of the monument in 1978 .
At a similar time a large timber circle and another avenue were constructed overlooking the River Avon away at Durrington Walls .
Opposing the solar alignments at Stonehenge , the circle was orientated towards the rising sun on the midwinter solstice , whilst the Avenue led from the river to the circle on an alignment to the setting sun on the summer solstice .
Evidence of huge fires on the banks of the Avon between the two avenues also suggests that both circles were linked , and perhaps formed a procession route used on the longest and shortest days of the year .
Parker Pearson speculates that the wooden circle at Durrington Walls was the centre of a ` land of the living ' , whilst the stone circle represented a ` land of the dead ' .
The Avon would have served as a journey between the two .
Stonehenge 3 III
Later in the Bronze Age , the bluestones appear to have been re-erected for the first time , although the exact details of this period are still unclear .
They were placed within the outer sarsen circle and at this time may have been trimmed in some way .
A few have timber working-style cuts in them like the sarsens themselves , suggesting they may have been linked with lintels and part of a larger structure during this phase .
Stonehenge 3 IV -LRB- 2280 BC to 1930 BC -RRB-
This phase saw further rearrangement of the bluestones as they were placed in a circle between the two settings of sarsens and in an oval in the very centre .
Some archaeologists argue that some of the bluestones in this period were part of a second group brought from Wales .
All the stones were well-spaced uprights without any of the linking lintels inferred in Stonehenge 3 III .
The Altar Stone may have been moved within the oval and stood vertically .
Although this would seem the most impressive phase of work , Stonehenge 3 IV was rather shabbily built compared to its immediate predecessors , as the newly re-installed bluestones were not at all well founded and began to fall over .
However , only minor changes were made after this phase .
Stonehenge 3 IV dates from 2280 to 1930 BC .
Stonehenge 3 V -LRB- 2280 BC to 1930 BC -RRB-
Soon afterwards , the north eastern section of the Phase 3 IV Bluestone circle was removed , creating a horseshoe-shaped setting termed the Bluestone Horseshoe .
This mirrored the shape of the central sarsen Trilithons and dates from 2270 to 1930 BC .
This phase is contemporary with the famous Seahenge site in Norfolk .
After the monument -LRB- 1600 BC on -RRB-
The last known construction at Stonehenge was about 1600 BC -LRB- see ` Y and Z Holes ` below -RRB- , and the last usage of it was likely during the Iron Age .
Roman coins and medieval artefacts have all been found in or around the monument but it is unknown if the monument was in continuous use throughout prehistory and beyond — or exactly how it would have been used .
Notable is the late 7th-6th century BC large arcing Scroll Trench which deepens E-NE towards Heelstone , and the construction of the massive Iron Age hillfort Vespasian 's Camp built alongside the Avenue near the Avon .
The burial of a decapitated 7th century Saxon man was excavated from Stonehenge .
The site was known by scholars during the Middle Ages and since then it has been studied and adopted by numerous different groups .
16th Century to present
The sun rising over Stonehenge on the summer solstice on 21 June , 2005
16th to 20th centuries
Stonehenge has changed ownership several times since King Henry VIII acquired Amesbury Abbey and its surrounding lands .
In 1540 Henry gave the estate to the Earl of Hertford .
It subsequently passed to Lord Carleton and then the Marquis of Queensbury .
The Antrobus family of Cheshire bought the estate in 1824 , but sold it in 1915 after their last heir was killed serving in France during the First World War .
The auction by Knight Frank & Rutley estate agents in Salisbury was held on 21 September and included `` Lot 15 .
Stonehenge with about 30 acres , 2 rods , 37 perches of adjoining downland . ''
-LSB- c. 12.4365 ha -RSB- Cecil Chubb bought Stonehenge for £6,600 and gave it to the nation three years later .
Although it has been speculated that he purchased it at the suggestion of — or even as a present for — his wife , he in fact bought it on a whim as he believed a local man should be the new owner .
1920s onwards
In the late 1920s a nation-wide appeal was launched to save Stonehenge from the encroachment of modern buildings that had begun to appear around it .
During World War I an aerodrome had been built on the down just west of the circle , and in the dry valley at Stonehenge Bottom a main road junction had appeared , with several cottages and a cafe .
In 1928 the land around the stones was purchased with the appeal donations , and given to the National Trust in order to preserve it .
The buildings were removed -LRB- although the roads were not -RRB- , and the land returned to agriculture .
More recently the land has been part of a grassland reversion scheme , returning the surrounding fields to native chalk grassland .
In 2002 a public poll voted Stonehenge as one of the Seven Wonders of Britain , alongside Big Ben , the Eden Project , Hadrian 's Wall , the London Eye , Windsor Castle , and York Minster .
Neopaganism
Stonehenge is a place of pilgrimage for neo-druids , and for certain others following pagan or neo-pagan beliefs .
The midsummer sunrise began attracting modern visitors in the 1870s , with the first record of recreated Druidic practices dating to 1905 when the Ancient Order of Druids enacted a ceremony .
Despite efforts by archaeologists and historians to stress the differences between the Iron Age Druidic religion and the much older monument , Stonehenge has become increasingly , almost inextricably , associated with British Druidism , Neopaganism and New Age philosophy .
Between 1972 and 1984 , Stonehenge was the site of a free festival .
After the Battle of the Beanfield in 1985 this use of the site was stopped for several years , and currently ritual use of Stonehenge is carefully controlled .
Setting and Access
As motorised traffic increased the setting of the monument began to be affected by the proximity of the two roads on either side of it — the A344 to Shrewton on the north side , and the A303 to Winterbourne Stoke to the south .
Plans to upgrade the A303 and remove it from the view of the stones have been considered since it became a World Heritage Site , but the controversy surrounding expensive re-routings of a road have led to the scheme being cancelled on multiple occasions .
On 6 December 2007 it was announced that extensive plans to build a tunnel under the landscape and create a permanent visitors centre had been cancelled .
On 13 May 2009 the government gave approval for a £25 million scheme to create a smaller visitors centre and close the A344 , although this is dependent on funding and planning permission .
When Stonehenge became open to the public it was possible to walk amongst and even climb on the stones .
However this ended in 1977 when the stones were roped off as a result of serious erosion .
Visitors are no longer permitted to touch the stones , but merely walk around the monument from a short distance .
English Heritage does however permit access during the summer and winter solstice , and the spring and autumn equinox .
Additionally , visitors can make special bookings to access the stones throughout the year .
The current access situation and the proximity of the two roads has drawn widespread criticism , highlighted by a 2006 National Geographic survey .
In the survey of conditions at 94 leading World Heritage Sites , 400 conservation and tourism experts ranked Stonehenge 75th in the list of destinations , declaring it to be `` in moderate trouble '' .
Function and construction
Stonehenge was produced by a culture with no written language , and at great historical remove from the first cultures that did leave written records .
Many aspects of Stonehenge remain subject to debate .
This multiplicity of theories , some of them very colourful , is often called the `` mystery of Stonehenge . ''
There is little or no direct evidence for the construction techniques used by the Stonehenge builders .
Over the years , various authors have suggested that supernatural or anachronistic methods were used , usually asserting that the stones were impossible to move otherwise .
However , conventional techniques using Neolithic technology have been demonstrably effective at moving and placing stones this size .
Proposed functions for the site include usage as an astronomical observatory , or as a religious site .
Other theories have advanced supernatural or symbolic explanations for the construction .
More recently two major new theories have been proposed .
Mike Parker Pearson , head of the Stonehenge Riverside Project , has suggested that Stonehenge was part of a ritual landscape and was joined to Durrington Walls by their corresponding avenues and the River Avon .
The area around Durrington Walls henge was a land of the living , whilst Stonehenge was a domain of the dead .
A journey along the Avon to reach Stonehenge was part of a ritual passage from life to death , to celebrate past ancestors and the recently deceased .
On the other hand , Geoffery Wainwright , president of the Society of Antiquaries of London , and Timothy Darvill of Bournemouth University have suggested that Stonehenge was a place of healing – the primeval equivalent of Lourdes .
They argue that this accounts for the high number of burials in the area and for the evidence of trauma deformity in some of the graves .
However they do concede that the site was probably multifunctional and used for ancestor worship as well .
Folklore
The Heelstone
`` Friar’s Heel '' or the `` Sunday Stone ''
The Heel Stone was once known as `` Friar 's Heel '' .
A folk tale , which can not be dated earlier than the seventeenth century , relates the origin of the name of this stone :
The Devil bought the stones from a woman in Ireland , wrapped them up , and brought them to Salisbury plain .
One of the stones fell into the Avon , the rest were carried to the plain .
The Devil then cried out , `` No-one will ever find out how these stones came here ! ''
A friar replied , `` That’s what you think ! , '' whereupon the Devil threw one of the stones at him and struck him on the heel .
The stone stuck in the ground and is still there .
Some claim `` Friar 's Heel '' is a corruption of `` Freyja 's He-ol '' or `` Freyja Sul '' , from the Nordic goddess Freyja and the Welsh word for way or Sunday , respectively , or the name may simply imply that the stone heels , or leans .
The name is not unique ; there was a monolith with the same name recorded in the 19th century by antiquarian Charles Warne at Long Bredy in Dorset .
Arthurian legend
A giant helps Merlin build Stonehenge .
From a manuscript of the Roman de Brut by Wace in the British Library -LRB- Egerton 3028 -RRB- .
This is the oldest known depiction of Stonehenge .
Stonehenge is also mentioned within Arthurian legend .
Geoffrey of Monmouth said that Merlin the wizard directed its removal from Ireland , where it had been constructed on Mount Killaraus by Giants , who brought the stones from Africa .
After it had been rebuilt near Amesbury , Geoffrey further narrates how first Ambrosius Aurelianus , then Uther Pendragon , and finally Constantine III , were buried inside the ring of stones .
In many places in his Historia Regum Britanniae Geoffrey mixes British legend and his own imagination ; it is intriguing that he connects Ambrosius Aurelianus with this prehistoric monument , seeing how there is place-name evidence to connect Ambrosius with nearby Amesbury .
According to Geoffrey of Monmouth , the rocks of Stonehenge were healing rocks which Giants brought from Africa to Ireland for their healing properties .
These rocks were called The Giant 's Dance .
Aurelius Ambrosias -LRB- 5th century -RRB- , wishing to erect a memorial to the nobles -LRB- 3000 -RRB- who had died in battle with the Saxons and were buried at Salisbury , chose -LRB- at Merlin 's advice -RRB- Stonehenge to be their monument .
So the King sent Merlin , Uther Pendragon -LRB- Arthur 's father -RRB- , and 15,000 knights to Ireland to retrieve the rocks .
They slew 7,000 Irish .
As the knights tried to move the rocks with ropes and force , they failed .
Then Merlin , using `` gear '' and skill , easily dismantled the stones and sent them over to Britain , where Stonehenge was dedicated .
Shortly after , Aurelius died and was buried within the Stonehenge monument , or `` The Giants ' Ring of Stonehenge '' .
Archaeological research and restoration
17th century depiction of Stonehenge
An early photograph of Stonehenge taken July 1877
The monument from a similar angle in 2008 showing the extent of reconstruction
Throughout recorded history Stonehenge and its surrounding monuments have attracted attention from antiquarians and archaeologists .
John Aubrey was one of the first to examine the site with a scientific eye in 1666 , and recorded in his plan of the monument the pits that now bear his name .
William Stukeley continued Aubrey’s work in the early 18th century , but took an interest in the surrounding monuments as well , identifying -LRB- somewhat incorrectly -RRB- the Cursus and the Avenue .
He also began the excavation of many of the barrows in the area , and it was his interpretation of the landscape that associated it with the Druids Stukeley was in fact so fascinated with Druids that he originally named Disc Barrows as Druids Barrows .
The most accurate early plan of Stonehenge was that made by Bath architect John Wood in 1740 .
His original annotated survey has recently been computer redrawn and published .
Importantly Wood’s plan was made before the collapse of the southwest Trilithon -LRB- which fell in 1797 ; restored 1958 -RRB- .
William Cunnington was the next to tackle the area in the early 19th century , excavating some 24 barrows before digging in and around the stones , discovering charred wood , animal bones , pottery and urns .
He also identified the hole in which the Slaughter Stone once stood .
At the same time Richard Colt Hoare began his activities , excavating some 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain before working with Cunnington and William Coxe on some 200 in the area around the Stones .
To alert future diggers to their work they were careful to leave initialled metal tokens in each barrow they opened .
In 1877 Charles Darwin dabbled in archaeology at the stones , experimenting with the rate at which remains sink into the earth for his book The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms .
William Gowland oversaw the first major restoration of the monument in 1901 – the straightening and concrete setting of sarsen stone number 56 which was in danger of falling .
Unfortunately in straightening it he also moved it about half a metre from its original position .
He also took the opportunity to further excavate the monument at the same time in what was the most scientific dig to date , revealing more about the erection of the stones than the previous 100 years of work .
During the 1920 restoration William Hawley , who had excavated nearby Old Sarum , excavated the base of six stones being restored as well as the outer ditch .
He also located a bottle of port in the slaughter stone socket left by Cunnington , helped to rediscover Aubrey 's pits inside the bank and located the Y and Z Holes -LRB- concentric circular holes outside the Sarsen Circle -RRB- .
Richard Atkinson , Stuart Piggott and John F. S. Stone re-excavated much of Hawley 's work in the 40s and 50s , and discovered the carved axes and daggers on the Sarsen Stones .
Atkinson 's work was instrumental in the understanding of the three major phases of the monument 's construction .
In 1958 the stones were restored again , using concrete settings to re-erect three of the standing sarsens .
The very last restoration was carried out in 1963 when stone 23 of the Sarsen Circle fell over and was once more re-erected , and the opportunity taken to concrete three more stones .
Later archaeologists , including Christopher Chippindale of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology , University of Cambridge and Brian Edwards of the University of the West of England campaigned to give the public more knowledge of the various restorations and in 2004 English Heritage included pictures of the works in progress in its new book Stonehenge : A History in Photographs .
In 1966 and 1967 , in advance of a new car park being built at the site , the area of land immediately northwest of the stones was excavated by Faith and Lance Vatcher .
They discovered the Mesolithic postholes dating from between 7 and 8,000 BC , as well as a 10m length of a palisade ditch – a V cut ditch into which timber posts had been inserted that remained there until they rotted away .
Subsequent aerial archaeology suggests that this ditch runs from the west to the north of Stonehenge , near the avenue .
Excavations were once again carried out in 1978 by Atkinson and John Evans during which they discovered the remains of the Stonehenge Archer from the outer ditch , and in 1979 rescue archaeology was needed alongside the Heel Stone after a cable-laying ditch was mistakenly dug on the roadside , revealing a new stone hole next to the Heel Stone .
In the early 1980’s Julian Richards led the Stonehenge Environs Project , a detailed study of the surrounding landscape .
The project was able to successfully date such features as the Lesser Cursus , Coneybury henge and several other smaller features .
More recent excavations include Mike Parker Pearson 's Stonehenge Riverside Project - a series of digs held between 2003 and 2008 .
This project mainly investigated other monuments in the landscape and their relationship with the stones - notably Durrington Walls where another ‘Avenue’ leading to the river Avon was discovered .
In April 2008 Professor Tim Darvill of the University of Bournemouth and Professor Geoff Wainwright of the Society of Antiquaries began another dig inside the Stone circle to retrieve dateable fragments of the original bluestone pillars .
They were able to date the erection of some bluestones to 2300BC , although this may not reflect the earliest erection of stones at Stonehenge .
They also discovered organic material from 7000 BC , which , along with the Mesolithic postholes , adds support for the site having been in use at least 4000 years before Stonehenge was started .
In August and September 2008 , as part of the Riverside Project Julian Richards and Mike Pitts excavated Aubrey Hole 7 , removing the cremated remains from several Aubrey Holes that had been excavated by Hawley in the 1920s , and re-interred in 1935 .

English Setter
The English Setter is a breed of dog .
It is part of the Setter family , which includes red Irish Setters , Irish Red and White Setters , and black-and-tan Gordon Setters .
The English Setter is a gun dog , bred for a mix of endurance and athleticism .
Description
Appearance
The coat is flat with light feathering of long length or short length depending on the type .
The bench or show type has a long , flowing coat that requires regular grooming .
The field or hunting type has a shorter coat that requires less grooming .
The various speckled coat colours when occurring in English Setters are referred to as belton ; valid combinations are white with black -LRB- blue belton -RRB- , white with orange flecks -LRB- orange belton -RRB- -RRB- , White with orange flecks and lighter nose is lemon belton , white with liver flecks -LRB- Liver Belton -RRB- or `` Tricolour '' which is blue or liver belton with Tan markings on the face , chest and legs .
Temperament
This breed 's standard temperament is best described as a `` Gentleman by Nature '' .
However , it can also be strong-willed and mischievous .
English Setters are energetic , people-oriented dogs , that are well suited to families who can give them attention and activity , or to working with a hunter , where they have a job to do .
They are active dogs outside that need plenty of exercise in a good sized fenced-in yard .
Inside they tend to be lower energy and love to be couch potatoes and lap dogs that love to cuddle .
Many are good around children .
Portrait of an English Setter
They rank 37th in Stanley Coren ` s The Intelligence of Dogs , being of above average working/obedience intelligence .
English Setters are very intelligent and can be trained to perform about any task another breed can do , with the exception of herding .
However , they are not always easy to train , as their natural bird instinct tends to distract them in outdoor environments .
Their temperament is considered a soft one .
Therefore they are very sensitive to criticism , and could be unwilling to repeat a behaviour out of fear to disappoint the trainer .
Positive reinforcement training methods therefore work best for English Setters .
Health
A relatively healthy breed , Setters have few genetic problems but some problems occasionally occur .
Canine hip dysplasia , elbow dysplasia , congenital deafness , and canine hypothyroidism are some of the more well-known ailments that can affect this dog .
A specific form of cancer is also common in older members of the breed .
Some lines are prone to allergies including food allergies .
Life expectancy is between 10-12 years , though with proper medical care 13 to 15 years is not out of the question .
History
The English Setter was originally bred to set or point upland game birds .
From the best available information , it appears that the English Setter was a trained bird dog in England more than 400 years ago .
There is evidence that the English Setter originated in crosses of the Spanish Pointer , large Water Spaniel , and Springer Spaniel , which combined to produce an excellent bird dog with a high degree of proficiency in finding and pointing game in open country .
The modern English Setter owes its appearance to Mr. Edward Laverack -LRB- 1800-1877 -RRB- , who developed his own strain of the breed by careful breeding during the 19th century in England and to another Englishman , Mr. R. Purcell Llewellin -LRB- 1840-1925 -RRB- , who based his strain upon Laverack 's and developed the working Setter .
Today , you still hear the term Llewellin Setter , but this is not a separate breed , they are however a completely separate and pure bloodline .
Field-bred English Setters are often mistakably referred to as `` Llewellin '' , but only DNA can tell the difference .
A four-month-old Llewellin Setter .
With time , Laverack bred successfully to produce beautiful representatives of the breed .
The first show for English Setters was held in 1859 at Newcastle upon Tyne .
The breed 's popularity soared across England as shows became more and more widespread .
Not long after , the first English Setters were brought to North America , including those that began the now-famous Llewellin strain recorded in the writing of Dr. William A Burette .
From this group of dogs came the foundation of the field-trial setter in America , `` Count Noble '' , who is currently mounted in the Carnegie Museum at Pittsburgh .
At present , the English is one of the most popular and elegant sporting breeds , often grouped with its cousins , the Irish and Gordon Setters .
The field type & show type English Setter look very different , even though they are the same breed .
Field type setters are often smaller and are seen with less feathering and usually more distinctive spotting than show type setters .
Both traits are beneficial in the field : less feathering makes getting burrs out of their coat easier and the spotting makes them easier to see in the field .
For this reason , in the English Setter breed , compared to other breeds , there are very few Dual Champions -LRB- dogs that have completed their show & field championship titles -RRB- .
English Setters have been among the premier breeds since the formation of the American Kennel Club .
Along with eight other Sporting breeds , they were among the first pure breeds accepted by the Club in 1878 .
In fact , the very first dog registered with the AKC was an English Setter named Adonis .
Miscellaneous
The name Llewellin Setter is given to a certain breed of Setters bred by R.L. Purcell Llewellin to be perfect for foot hunting and early field trials .
The breed was very successfully advertised even though losing to Joe , Jr. in the great match race between the Cambell -LRB- George M. Cambell of Springhill , Tennessee -RRB- native English Setter strain and the blue blooded Llewellin Setter Gladstone of an American strain of Llewellin Setter .
Because of the major change in American field trials to big , wide running field trials their field trail performance began to decline against the bigger running pointers after 1914 when pointer Commanche Frank won the National Bird Dog Championship .
But the obsession with the Llewellin breed as champion foot hunting bird dogs and excellent family companions occurs at the same time pointers began to dominate wide ranging field trials .
The Llewellin Setter breed is making a huge come back with the loss of large areas to hunt , leaving hunters the need for a closer ranging hunting dog and family companion .
There are basically two lines of Llewellin Setters recognized today .
They are the `` American Llewellins '' developed from lines of early English imports from the late 1800s and early 1900s that were mainly developed by American field trial breeders .
The second is the `` Dashing Bondhu '' line developed personally by R.L. Purcell Llewellin himself for 50 years and with William Humphrey also in England for 38 more years and Fr. Brannon in Ireland for 30 plus years .
These were not imported to America until the 1960s and ` 80s .
The breeding of these pure Dashing Bondhus in America resulted in producing the most famous of all Llewellin Setters known today .
The famous `` Henry Princeof Paws '' , aka `` Hank '' fame of the Outdoor Life Network ` OLN ' Channel series known as Hunting with Hank .
Aside from the separately recognized Llewellin Setter breed with FDSB registry in 1902 and with the International Progressive Dog Breeders ' Alliance -LRB- IPDBA -RRB- registry in 1996 , there are many other unrecognized regional strains of English setters .
One such strain , the Newfoundland Setter , was accomplished by breeding English , Irish and Gordon setters together over a period of hundreds of years .
The result is a setter which is almost perfectly adapted to the local terrain and can display the visual traits/colours from any of the setter types .

Deep Web
The deep Web -LRB- also called Deepnet , the invisible Web , dark Web or the hidden Web -RRB- refers to World Wide Web content that is not part of the surface Web , which is indexed by standard search engines .
Mike Bergman , credited with coining the phrase , has said that searching on the Internet today can be compared to dragging a net across the surface of the ocean ; a great deal may be caught in the net , but there is a wealth of information that is deep and therefore missed .
Most of the Web 's information is buried far down on dynamically generated sites , and standard search engines do not find it .
Traditional search engines can not `` see '' or retrieve content in the deep Web – those pages do not exist until they are created dynamically as the result of a specific search .
The deep Web is several orders of magnitude larger than the surface Web .
Naming
Bergman , in a seminal , early paper on the deep Web published in the Journal of Electronic Publishing , mentioned that Jill Ellsworth used the term invisible Web in 1994 to refer to websites that are not registered with any search engine .
Bergman cited a January 1996 article by Frank Garcia : `` It would be a site that 's possibly reasonably designed , but they didn't bother to register it with any of the search engines .
So , no one can find them !
You're hidden .
I call that the invisible Web . ''
Another early use of the term invisible Web was by Bruce Mount and Matthew B. Koll of Personal Library Software , in a description of the @ 1 deep Web tool found in a December 1996 press release .
The first use of the specific term deep Web , now generally accepted , occurred in the aforementioned 2001 Bergman study .
Size
In 2000 , it was estimated that the deep Web contained approximately 7,500 terabytes of data and 550 billion individual documents .
Estimates based on extrapolations from a study done at University of California , Berkeley , show that the deep Web consists of about 91,000 terabytes .
By contrast , the surface Web -LRB- which is easily reached by search engines -RRB- is only about 167 terabytes ; the Library of Congress , in 1997 , was estimated to have perhaps 3,000 terabytes .
Deep resources
Deep Web resources may be classified into one or more of the following categories :
Dynamic content : dynamic pages which are returned in response to a submitted query or accessed only through a form , especially if open-domain input elements -LRB- such as text fields -RRB- are used ; such fields are hard to navigate without domain knowledge .
Unlinked content : pages which are not linked to by other pages , which may prevent Web crawling programs from accessing the content .
This content is referred to as pages without backlinks -LRB- or inlinks -RRB- .
Private Web : sites that require registration and login -LRB- password-protected resources -RRB- .
Contextual Web : pages with content varying for different access contexts -LRB- e.g. , ranges of client IP addresses or previous navigation sequence -RRB- .
Limited access content : sites that limit access to their pages in a technical way -LRB- e.g. , using the Robots Exclusion Standard , CAPTCHAs , or no-cache Pragma HTTP headers which prohibit search engines from browsing them and creating cached copies -RRB- .
Scripted content : pages that are only accessible through links produced by JavaScript as well as content dynamically downloaded from Web servers via Flash or AJAX solutions .
Non-HTML/text content : textual content encoded in multimedia -LRB- image or video -RRB- files or specific file formats not handled by search engines .
Accessing
To discover content on the Web , search engines use web crawlers that follow hyperlinks .
This technique is ideal for discovering resources on the surface Web but is often ineffective at finding deep Web resources .
For example , these crawlers do not attempt to find dynamic pages that are the result of database queries due to the infinite number of queries that are possible .
It has been noted that this can be -LRB- partially -RRB- overcome by providing links to query results , but this could unintentionally inflate the popularity -LRB- e.g. , PageRank -RRB- for a member of the deep Web .
One way to access the deep Web is via federated search based search engines .
Search tools such as Science.gov are being designed to retrieve information from the deep Web .
These tools identify and interact with searchable databases , aiming to provide access to deep Web content .
Another way to explore the deep Web is by using human crawlers instead of algorithmic crawlers .
In this paradigm , referred to as Web harvesting , humans find interesting links of the deep Web that algorithmic crawlers can't find .
This human-based computation technique to discover the deep Web has been used by the StumbleUpon service since February 2002 .
In 2005 , Yahoo ! made a small part of the deep Web searchable by releasing Yahoo ! Subscriptions .
This search engine searches through a few subscription-only Web sites .
Some subscription websites display their full content to search engine robots so they will show up in user searches , but then show users a login or subscription page when they click a link from the search engine results page .
Crawling the deep Web
Researchers have been exploring how the deep Web can be crawled in an automatic fashion .
In 2001 , Sriram Raghavan and Hector Garcia-Molina presented an architectural model for a hidden-Web crawler that used key terms provided by users or collected from the query interfaces to query a Web form and crawl the deep Web resources .
Alexandros Ntoulas , Petros Zerfos , and Junghoo Cho of UCLA created a hidden-Web crawler that automatically generated meaningful queries to issue against search forms .
Their crawler generated promising results , but the problem is far from being solved , as the authors recognized .
Another effort is DeepPeep , a project of the University of Utah sponsored by the National Science Foundation , which gathered hidden-Web sources -LRB- Web forms -RRB- in different domains based on novel focused crawler techniques .
Commercial search engines have begun exploring alternative methods to crawl the deep Web .
The Sitemap Protocol -LRB- first developed by Google -RRB- and mod oai are mechanisms that allow search engines and other interested parties to discover deep Web resources on particular Web servers .
Both mechanisms allow Web servers to advertise the URLs that are accessible on them , thereby allowing automatic discovery of resources that are not directly linked to the surface Web .
Google 's deep Web surfacing system pre-computes submissions for each HTML form and adds the resulting HTML pages into the Google search engine index .
The surfaced results account for a thousand queries per second to deep Web content..
In this system , the pre-computation of submissions is done using three algorithms : -LRB- 1 -RRB- selecting input values for text search inputs that accept keywords , -LRB- 2 -RRB- identifying inputs which accept only values of a specific type -LRB- e.g. , date -RRB- , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- selecting a small number of input combinations that generate URLs suitable for inclusion into the Web search index .
Classifying resources
It is difficult to automatically determine if a Web resource is a member of the surface Web or the deep Web .
If a resource is indexed by a search engine , it is not necessarily a member of the surface Web , because the resource could have been found using another method -LRB- e.g. , the Sitemap Protocol , mod oai , OAIster -RRB- instead of traditional crawling .
If a search engine provides a backlink for a resource , one may assume that the resource is in the surface Web .
Unfortunately , search engines do not always provide all backlinks to resources .
Even if a backlink does exist , there is no way to determine if the resource providing the link is itself in the surface Web without crawling all of the Web .
Furthermore , a resource may reside in the surface Web , but it has not yet been found by a search engine .
Therefore , if we have an arbitrary resource , we can not know for sure if the resource resides in the surface Web or deep Web without a complete crawl of the Web .
The concept of classifying search results by topic was pioneered by Yahoo ! Directory search and is gaining importance as search becomes more relevant in day-to-day decisions .
However , most of the work here has been in categorizing the surface Web by topic .
For classification of deep Web resources , Ipeirotis et al. presented an algorithm that classifies a deep Web site into the category that generates the largest number of hits for some carefully selected , topically-focused queries .
Deep Web directories under development include as OAIster at the University of Michigan , Intute at the University of Manchester , INFOMINE at the University of California at Riverside , and DirectSearch -LRB- by Gary Price -RRB- .
This classification poses a challenge while searching the deep Web whereby two levels of categorization are required .
The first level is to categorize sites into vertical topics -LRB- e.g. , health , travel , automobiles -RRB- and sub-topics according to the nature of the content underlying their databases .
The more difficult challenge is to categorize and map the information extracted from multiple deep Web sources according to end-user needs .
Deep Web search reports can not display URLs like traditional search reports .
End users expect their search tools to not only find what they are looking for quickly , but to be intuitive and user-friendly .
In order to be meaningful , the search reports have to offer some depth to the nature of content that underlie the sources or else the end-user will be lost in the sea of URLs that do not indicate what content lies underneath them .
The format in which search results are to be presented varies widely by the particular topic of the search and the type of content being exposed .
The challenge is to find and map similar data elements from multiple disparate sources so that search results may be exposed in a unified format on the search report irrespective of their source .
Future
The lines between search engine content and the deep Web have begun to blur , as search services start to provide access to part or all of once-restricted content .
An increasing amount of deep Web content is opening up to free search as publishers and libraries make agreements with large search engines .
In the future , deep Web content may be defined less by opportunity for search than by access fees or other types of authentication .

Great Dane
The Great Dane , Danish Hound , Danish Gallant , Deutsche Dogge , Boarhound , Grand Danois or German Mastiff is a breed of domestic dog -LRB- Canis lupus familiaris -RRB- known for its giant size and gentle personality .
The breed is commonly referred to as the `` Apollo of all breeds . ''
Great Danes are considered one of the tallest dog breeds along with the Irish Wolfhound .
More recently , Great Danes have been in the Guinness World Records for tallest dog .
The Great Dane was named the state dog of Pennsylvania in 1965 .
Although the current holder of the world record for tallest dog is a tall Great Dane , the Irish Wolfhound is the breed that tends to be tallest , though it is lighter in weight .
History
Historians claim that there are drawings of dogs that resemble the breed on Egyptian monuments from roughly 3000 B.C .
It is also reported that the Great Dane was developed from mastiff-like dogs taken to Germany by the Alans .
The Bullenbeisser may be its direct ancestor , composing about the 40 % of its make-up .
Great Danes Gislev church , Denmark 1500-25
According to Barbara Stein , `` The breed originated in Germany , probably from a cross between the English mastiff and the Irish Wolfhound . ''
However , other sources maintain that the breed originated in Denmark and still others report the question as controversial and unsettled .
URL_http In 1749 Georges-Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon used the name ”le Grand Danois , ” -LRB- translated by William Smellie -LRB- encyclopedist -RRB- as ”Great Dane” -RRB- .
Up until that time the hound was referred to in England as ”Danish dog.”
The Great Dane Raro , Denmark 1655
According to Jacob Nicolay Wilse the Danes called the dog ”large hound , ” a terminology continued well in to the 20th Century .
The Great Dane Sultan , Denmark 1699
In Germany in 1780 the hound is referred to as ”Grosser Dänischer Jagd Hund” -LRB- -RRB- .
At the first dog exhibition , held in Hamburg 14-20 July 1863 , eight dogs were called ”Dänische Dogge” and seven ”Ulmer Doggen.”
The origin of the name Great Dane is curious .
The breed can be traced back to Germany , not Denmark as often thought because of the Anglo-Saxon name .
The reason why in Anglo Saxon and French speaking countries refer to the German Mastiff still as Great Dane are political reasons of historical issues especially during the unification of Germany by Prussia and Bismarck .
The breed had many names in the Holy Roman Empire , depending on its origin .
The oldest trackable breeders were in the states of Württemberg and Hesse .
All regions had their favourite colour of coat .
This led to the confusion during the first breeder exhibition in Germany in 1863 , when breeders from all over the country signed in dogs of the same breed under different breed names .
When it was decided during the German Dog Exhibition in Hamburg Altona that there should be a united name for this old German breed it was decisive that this dog would be called `` Deutsche Dogge '' -LRB- German Mastiff -RRB- at a time when Germany united and Prussia became a European Power in defeating France .
Britain or France would not call a dog `` Great German '' .
The precursors of today 's Great Dane are the old `` Bullenbeisser '' as well as the so-called `` Hatz- and Sauhunde '' -LRB- hounds -RRB- , which are a cross between the strong Mastiff of the English type and a fast and nimble Greyhound .
At first , big and strong dogs that did not necessarily belong to a certain breed were considered as Danes .
Later on , names like Ulmer Dane , English Dane , Danish Dane , `` Saupacker '' -LRB- wild boar hunt -RRB- and big Dane described the different sizes and colors of this type .
A female blue Great Dane
In 1878 a committee of seven , consisting of committed breeders and judges with the chairman Dr Bodinus , decided in Berlin to unite all varieties of the above-mentioned types under the term `` Deutsche Dogge '' -LRB- German Dane , ie Great Dane -RRB- .
Through this the foundation for the first German dog breed has been laid .
In 1880 , on the occasion of a dog show in Berlin , a standard for the Great Dane was determined for the first time .
Since 1888 , the `` Deutsche Doggen Club 1888 e.V. '' is in charge of this standards and repeatedly modified it since .
Today 's edition fulfills the demands of the F.C.I .
Description
Appearance
In the United States , the breed standard for the Great Dane is described on the American Kennel Club website .
`` The Great Dane combines , in its regal appearance , dignity , strength and elegance with grand size and a well-formed body .
One of the largest working breeds , it never appears clumsy . ''
The male should appear more massive throughout than the female , with larger frame and heavier bone .
In the ratio between length and height , the Great Dane should be square .
In females , a somewhat longer body is permissible , providing she is well proportioned to her height .
Coarseness or lack of substance are equally undesirable .
The male shall not be less than at the shoulders , but it is preferable that he be or more , providing he is well proportioned to his height .
The female shall not be less than at the shoulders , but it is preferable that she be , providing she is well proportioned to her height .
Danes under minimum height must be disqualified .
There used to be a minimum weight requirement , but the current standard does not call for this .
they are also known for their long and narrow head
In August 2004 , a Great Dane named `` Gibson '' from Grass Valley , California was recognized by the Guinness Book of Records as the world 's tallest dog , measuring at the withers .
Gibson lost one of his front legs to cancer in 2009 .
It is not in the best interest of the breed to attempt to achieve the `` tallest '' dog .
Breeding for height can sacrifice structure and conformation and produce unhealthy dogs .
Coat colors
There are six show-acceptable coat colors for Great Danes :
Fawn : The color is yellow gold with a black mask .
Black should appear on the eye rims and eyebrows , and may appear on the ears .
Brindle : The color is fawn and black in a chevron stripe pattern .
Often also they are referred to as having a tiger -stripe pattern .
Blue puppy
Blue : The color is a pure steel blue .
White markings at the chest and toes are not desirable and considered faults .
Black : The color is a glossy black .
White markings at the chest and toes are not desirable and considered faults .
Harlequin : The base color is pure white with black torn patches irregularly and well distributed over the entire body ; a pure white neck is preferred .
The black patches should never be large enough to give the appearance of a blanket , nor so small as to give a stippled or dappled effect .
Eligible , but less desirable , are a few small grey patches -LRB- this grey is consistent with a Merle marking -RRB- or a white base with single black hairs showing through , which tend to give a salt and pepper or dirty effect .
Mantle -LRB- in some countries referred to as Bostons due to the similar coloration and pattern as a Boston Terrier -RRB- : The color is black and white with a solid black blanket extending over the body ; black skull with white muzzle ; white blaze is optional ; whole white collar preferred ; a white chest ; white on part or whole of forelegs and hind legs ; white tipped black tail .
A small white marking in the black blanket is acceptable , as is a break in the white collar .
Great Danes of several coat types , from left to right : harlequin , black , brindle , blue and fawn
Other colors occur occasionally but are not acceptable for conformation showing , and they are not pursued by breeders who intend to breed show dogs .
These colors include white , fawnequin , merle , merlequin , fawn mantle , and others .
Some breeders may attempt to charge more for puppies of these `` rare '' colors .
However , the breeding of white and merle Danes is particularly controversial , as these colors may be associated with genes that produce deafness .
In the past , when Great Danes were commonly used to hunt boars , cropping of the ears was performed to make injuries to the dogs ' ears less likely during hunts .
Now that Danes are primarily companion animals , cropping is sometimes still done for traditional and cosmetic reasons .
Today , the practice is somewhat common in the United States and much less common in Europe .
In some European countries such as the UK , Denmark , Germany , parts of Australia , and in New Zealand , the practice is banned , or controlled to only be performed by veterinary surgeons .
Temperament
The Great Dane 's large and imposing appearance belies its friendly nature ; the breed is often referred to as a gentle giant .
Great Danes are generally well-disposed toward other dogs , other non-canine pets and humans .
As with all dogs , they should be supervised around young children .
Great Danes can be protective and make good guard dogs .
Some Great Danes — as with any breed — can have dominance issues , can be aggressive with other dogs , or chase small animals ; however , this is not typical .
Exercise
Because Great Danes have a fairly slow metabolism they need daily exercise the same as any other dog , and a fair amount of it .
Great Danes Running
Great Danes Running
A common misconception is that they are slow and docile and don't need walking ; this is incorrect and in most cases Great Danes are full of energy and need regular walking .
The Great Dane was bred to hunt wild boar and guard the manor .
They are robust , alert and agile when needed to be .
Health
Great Danes , like most giant dogs , have a fairly slow metabolism .
This results in less energy and less food consumption per pound of dog than in small breeds .
Great Danes have some health problems that are common to large breeds .
Bloat -LRB- a painful distending and twisting of the stomach formally known as Gastric volvulus -RRB- is a critical condition that can affect Great Danes and results rapidly in death if not quickly addressed .
Drinking large amounts of fluid in a short period of time can provoke Bloating in Great Danes , as well as other larger breeds of dogs .
It is a commonly recommended practice for Great Danes to have their stomachs tacked -LRB- Gastropexy -RRB- to the right abdominal wall during routine surgery such as spaying or neutering if the dog or its relatives have a history of bloat , though some veterinary surgeons will not do the operation if the actual sickness has not occurred .
Elevated food dishes are often believed to help prevent bloat by regulating the amount of air that is inhaled while eating , although one study suggests that they may increase the risk .
Refraining from exercise or activity immediately before and after meals may also reduce risk , although this has not been validated with research .
Another problem common to the breed is hip dysplasia .
Typically an x-ray of the parents can certify whether their hips are healthy and can serve as a guideline for whether the animals should be bred and are likely to have healthy pups .
Great Danes generally live 8–10 years , but with responsible breeding and improved nutrition they can live to be 12-14 .
Dilated cardiomyopathy -LRB- DCM -RRB- and many congenital heart diseases are also commonly found in the Great Dane .
Which often leads to its nick name of the Heart break breed , in conjunction with its shorter lifespan .
Great Danes also suffer from several genetic disorders that are specific to the breed .
For example , if a Great Dane lacks color -LRB- is white -RRB- near its eyes or ears then that organ does not develop and usually the dog will be either blind or deaf .

Creator Iwao Takamoto based this famous animal character on a Great Dane based on sketches given by a Hanna-Barbera employee who bred this dog , although Scooby 's tail is longer than a real Great Dane 's and actually bears a closer resemblance to a cat 's tail .
In one episode of the original series , one of the characters says that he 's part- terrier and `` part-terrified '' in response to someone asking what kind of dog he is .
`` Part-terrified '' was most likely added for humor , but he might possibly be part-terrier .

Employment agency
An employment agency is a company that matches workers to open jobs .
The first employment agency in the United States was opened by Fred Winslow who opened Engineering Agency in 1893 .
It later became part of General Employment Enterprises who also owned Businessmen 's Clearing House -LRB- est. 1902 -RRB- .
Another of the oldest agencies was developed by Katharine Felton as a response to the problems brought on by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire .
Temporary staffing firm
A temporary agency may be distinct from a recruitment firm , which seeks to place permanent employees , but there is often a large overlap : temporary workers may go on to become permanent employees ; or workers a company intends to hire as a permanent employee may start out as trial temporary worker .
In the UK the temporary worker is technically self employed & introduced by the recruitment agency to working on site for the client who pay the bills .
The agency is responsible for paying the temporary worker plus paying employers national insurance to the government and setting aside holiday pay -LRB- working time directive or WTR -LRB- regulations -RRB- -RRB- .
This total cost then has a profit margin added and is charged per hour to the client .
The temporary worker fills in timesheets -LRB- often online -RRB- and is paid by BACS on a weekly basis .
Some industries in the UK are more heavily regulated by the gangmaster regulations .
Many UK manufacturing companies rely heavily on `` Temp Staff '' during periods of high demand , in recent years U.K agencies have responded to the demand for high quantities of cheap temporary labour by `` shipping people in '' from within the EU particularly eastern Europe and former Soviet states .
The vast majority of these workers are employed using a contract for services and rarely earn more than the national minimum wage .
Many temporary agencies specialize in a particular profession or field of business , such as accounting , health care , technical , or secretarial .
Legal status
For most of the twentieth century , private employment agencies were considered quasi illegal entities under international law .
The International Labour Organization instead called for the establishment of public employment agencies .
To prevent the abusive practices of private agencies , they were either to be fully abolished , or tightly regulated .
In most countries they are legal but regulated .
Probably inspired by the dissenting judgments in a US Supreme Court case called Adams v. Tanner , the International Labour Organization ` s first ever Recommendation was targeted at fee charging agencies .
The Unemployment Recommendation , 1919 -LRB- No.1 -RRB- , Art .
1 called for each member to ,
`` take measures to prohibit the establishment of employment agencies which charge fees or which carry on their business for profit .
Where such agencies already exist , it is further recommended that they be permitted to operate only under government licenses , and that all practicable measures be taken to abolish such agencies as soon as possible . ''
The Unemployment Convention , 1919 , Art .
2 instead required the alternative of ,
`` a system of free public employment agencies under the control of a central authority .
Committees , which shall include representatives of employers and workers , shall be appointed to advise on matters concerning the carrying on of these agencies . ''
In 1933 the Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention -LRB- No.34 -RRB- formally called for abolition .
The exception was if the agencies were licensed and a fee scale was agreed in advance .
In 1949 a new revised Convention -LRB- No.96 -RRB- was produced .
This kept the same scheme , but secured an ‘opt out’ -LRB- Art.2 -RRB- for members that did not wish to sign up .
Agencies were an increasingly entrenched part of the labor market .
The United States did not sign up to the Conventions .
The latest Convention , the Private Employment Agencies Convention , 1997 -LRB- No.181 -RRB- takes a much softer stance and calls merely for regulation .
In most countries , agencies are regulated , for instance in the UK under the Employment Agencies Act 1973 , or in Germany under the Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz -LRB- Employee Hiring Law of 1972 -RRB- .
Executive recruitment
A third-party recruiter can work on their own or through an agency , and acts as an independent contact between their client companies and the candidates they recruit for a position .
They can specialize in client relationships only -LRB- sales or business development -RRB- , in finding candidates -LRB- recruiting or sourcing -RRB- , or in both areas .
Most recruiters tend to specialize in permanent or full-time , direct hire positions or contract positions , but occasionally in both .
In an executive search assignment , the client hiring company , not the job seeker , pays the search firm its fee .
An executive search firm is a type of employment agency that specializes in recruiting executive personnel for companies in various industries .
Two of the largest executive search firms in the U.S. are Korn/Ferry International -LRB- CEO : Paul Reilly -RRB- based in Los Angeles ; and Heidrick & Struggles -LRB- CEO : Gerard Roche -RRB- based in Chicago .

Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic
The Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic or the Ukrainian SSR was one of the founders of the USSR and a republic that made up the former Soviet Union from its formation in 1922 to its abolishment in 1991 .
Name
The first Bolshevik republic declared in December 1917 was called the Soviet Republic of Ukraine -LRB- Respublyka Rad Ukrayiny -RRB- .
The third Bolshevik republic of December 1919 was known as the Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic .
Its Ukrainian initials were УРСС -LRB- URSS -RRB- .
In 1937 , the republic 's name was changed again , per new Constitution adopted , c along with the names of all other Soviet republics , transposing the second and third words .
It would be known from 1937–91 as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic , abbreviated Ukrainian SSR , UkrSSR , or UkSSR .
The official names in Ukrainian and Russian were :
History
After the break-up of the Russian Empire , several factions sought to create an independent Ukrainian state , alternately co-operating and struggling against each other .
Ukrainian Bolsheviks and Mensheviks first participated in the formation of the Ukrainian National Republic -LRB- UNR -RRB- , which initially declared autonomy in 1917 , and then independence in 1918 .

The Bolsheviks favoured federation with Russia , but lacking broad popular support within Central Ukraine but supported at industrial centres of East Ukraine , convened a separate congress and declared the first Soviet Republic of Ukraine on December 25 , 1917 .
Warfare ensued against the UNR , and a series of alliances and conflicts with anarchists and neo- haydamak bands .
After the failed first stage of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk , the Central Powers captured almost all Ukrainian territory and Ukrainian Bolsheviks were pushed out of Ukraine altogether , and having the government dissolved for two interludes lasting several months -LRB- being reformed on November 20 , 1918 , and December 21 , 1919 -RRB- .
Eventually , with the support of the Red Army and local Anarchists , the Ukrainian SSR ended up controlling much of Ukrainian territory after the Polish-Soviet Peace of Riga .
On December 30 , 1922 , along with the Russian , Byelorussian , and Transcaucasian republics , the Ukrainian SSR was one of the founding members of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -LRB- USSR -RRB- .
In 1932 the government inflicted one of the largest national catastrophes in modern history of the Ukrainian nation .
A man-made famine known as the Holodomor caused a direct loss of human life estimated between 2.6 and 3.5 million , while numbers as high as 10 million are sometimes cited in the media .
In September 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Poland , and added Galician lands inhabited by Ukrainians to the territory of the Ukrainian SSR .
In 1945 , these lands were permanently annexed , and the Transcarpathia region was added as well , by treaty with the post-war administration of Czechoslovakia .
After World War II some amendments to the Constitution of the Ukrainian SSR were accepted , which allowed it to act as a separate subject of international law in some cases and to a certain extent , remaining a part of the Soviet Union at the same time .
In particular , these amendments allowed the Ukrainian SSR to become one of founding members of the United Nations -LRB- UN -RRB- together with the Soviet Union and the Byelorussian SSR .
This was part of a deal with the United States to ensure a degree of balance in the General Assembly , which , the USSR opined , was unbalanced in favor of the Western Bloc .
In its capacity as a member of the UN , the Ukrainian SSR was an elected member of the United Nations Security Council 1948-1949 and 1984-1985 .
The Ukrainian SSR was also the site of the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 , when a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant melted down and exploded , subjecting countless multitudes to radiological effects .
The Ukrainian SSR was officially renamed Ukraine on August 24 , 1991 .
It declared its intention of leaving the Soviet Union the same day , and on December 25 , 1991 became fully independent following the dissolution of the Soviet Union .

Administrative divisions
The administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR changed numerous times throughout its 74-year history .
The most common administrative division was the oblast -LRB- province -RRB- of which there were 25 upon the UkSSR 's abolishment in 1991 .
Most of the UkSSR 's oblasts still exist to this day as part of independent Ukraine while one changed its status to an autonomous republic .

In 1934 , the capital was moved from Kharkiv to Kiev -LRB- Ukr .
Kyiv -RRB- , which remains the capital of Ukraine today .
Other administrative divisions of the Ukrainian SSR included the two Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics which existed during different time periods .
The Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic existed from 1924-1940 until it was upgraded to that of a constituent Soviet republic in 1940 .
The other ASSR was the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic which was formed in 1991 from the former Crimean Oblast , which was transferred to the Ukrainian SSR from the Russian SFSR in 1954 .
After Ukrainian independence , the Crimean ASSR was renamed the Crimean Autonomous Republic .

Protestant Reformation
The Protestant Reformation was a Christian reform movement in Europe which is generally deemed to have begun with Martin Luther ` s Ninety-Five Theses although a number of precursors such as Johannes Hus predate that event .
As a historical period , the Reformation is considered to have ended with the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 ; however , many of the denominations that arose during that period continue to exist and Protestantism constitues one of the branches of Christianity today .
The movement began as an attempt to reform the Catholic Church .
Many western Catholics were troubled by what they saw as false doctrines and malpractices within the Church , particularly involving the teaching and sale of indulgences .
Another major contention was the practice of buying and selling church positions -LRB- simony -RRB- and what was seen at the time as considerable corruption within the Church 's hierarchy .
This corruption was seen by many at the time as systemic , even reaching the position of the Pope .
Martin Luther 's spiritual predecessors included men such as John Wycliffe and Johannes Hus , who had attempted to reform the church along similar lines .
The Reformation is generally deemed to have begun on October 31 , 1517 , in Wittenberg , Saxony -LRB- in present-day Germany -RRB- .
There , Luther nailed his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of the All Saints ' Church , which served as a notice board for university-related announcements .
These were points for debate that criticized the Church and the Pope .
The most controversial points centered on the practice of selling indulgences and the Church 's policy on purgatory .
Other reformers , such as Ulrich Zwingli , soon followed .
Beliefs and practices under attack by Protestant reformers included purgatory , particular judgment , devotion to Mary -LRB- Mariology -RRB- , the intercession of and devotion to the saints , most of the sacraments , the mandatory celibacy requirement of its clergy -LRB- including monasticism -RRB- , and the authority of the Pope .
The reform movement soon split along certain doctrinal lines .
Spiritual disagreements between Luther and Zwingli , and later between Luther and John Calvin , led to the emergence of rival Protestant churches .
The most important denominations to emerge directly from the Reformation were the Lutherans , and the Reformed / Calvinists / Presbyterians .
The process of reform had decidedly different causes and effects in other countries .
In England , where it gave rise to Anglicanism , the period became known as the English Reformation .
Subsequent Protestant denominations generally trace their roots back to the initial reforming movements .
The reformers also accelerated the Catholic or Counter Reformation within the Catholic Church .
The Protestant Reformation is also referred to as the German Reformation , Protestant Revolution or Protestant Revolt .
History and Origins
Historical chart of the main protestant branches
All mainstream Protestants generally trace their separation from the Catholic Church to the 16th century .
The origin of mainstream Protestantism is sometimes called the Magisterial Reformation because the movement received support from the magistrates , the ruling authorities -LRB- as opposed to the Radical Reformation , which had no state sponsorship -RRB- .
Older Protestant churches , such as the Unitas Fratrum -LRB- Unity of the Brethren -RRB- , Moravian Brethren or the Bohemian Brethren trace their origin to the time of Jan Hus in the early 15th century .
As it was led by a majority of Bohemian nobles and recognized for a time by the Basel Compacts , this was the first Magisterial Reformation in Europe .
In Germany , a hundred years later , the protests erupted in many places at once , during a time of threatened Islamic Ottoman invasion 1 which distracted German princes in particular .
To some degree , the protest can be explained by the events of the previous two centuries in Europe and particularly in Bohemia .
Roots and precursors : 14th century and 15th century
Unrest due to the Great Schism of Western Christianity -LRB- 1378–1416 -RRB- excited wars between princes , uprisings among the peasants , and widespread concern over corruption in the Church .
A new nationalism also challenged the relatively internationalist medieval world .
The first of a series of disruptive and new perspectives came from John Wycliffe at Oxford University , then from Jan Hus at the University of Prague .
The Catholic Church officially concluded this debate at the Council of Constance -LRB- 1414–1417 -RRB- .
The conclave condemned Jan Hus , who was executed by burning in spite of a promise of safe-conduct .
Wycliffe was posthumously burned as a heretic .
The Council of Constance confirmed and strengthened the traditional medieval conception of Church and Empire .
It did not address the national tensions , or the theological tensions which had been stirred up during the previous century .
The council could not prevent schism and the Hussite Wars in Bohemia .
Historical upheaval usually yields much new thinking as to how society should be organized .
This was the case leading up to the Protestant Reformation .
Following the breakdown of monastic institutions and scholasticism in late medieval Europe , accentuated by the `` Babylonian Captivity '' of the Avignon Papacy , the Great Schism , and the failure of the Conciliar movement , the sixteenth century saw the fomenting of a great cultural debate about religious reforms and later fundamental religious values -LRB- See German mysticism -RRB- .
Historians would generally assume that the failure to reform -LRB- too many vested interests , lack of coordination in the reforming coalition -RRB- would eventually lead to a greater upheaval or even revolution , since the system must eventually be adjusted or disintegrate , and the failure of the Conciliar movement helped lead to the Protestant Reformation in Europe .
These frustrated reformist movements ranged from nominalism , devotio moderna -LRB- modern devotion -RRB- , to humanism occurring in conjunction with economic , political and demographic forces that contributed to a growing disaffection with the wealth and power of the elite clergy , sensitizing the population to the financial and moral corruption of the secular Renaissance church .
The outcome of the Black Death encouraged a radical reorganization of the economy , and eventually of European society .
In the emerging urban centers , however , the calamities of the fourteenth and early fifteenth century , and the resultant labor shortages , provided a strong impetus for economic diversification and technological innovations .
Following the Black Death , the initial loss of life due to famine , plague , and pestilence contributed to an intensification of capital accumulation in the urban areas , and thus a stimulus to trade , industry , and burgeoning urban growth in fields as diverse as banking -LRB- the Fugger banking family in Augsburg and the Medici family of Florence being the most prominent -RRB- ; textiles , armaments , especially stimulated by the Hundred Years ' War , and mining of iron ore due , in large part , to the booming armaments industry .
Accumulation of surplus , competitive overproduction , and heightened competition to maximize economic advantage , contributed to civil war , aggressive militarism , and thus to centralization .
As a direct result of the move toward centralization , leaders like Louis XI of France -LRB- 1461–1483 -RRB- , the `` spider king '' , sought to remove all constitutional restrictions on the exercise of their authority .
In England , France , and Spain the move toward centralization begun in the thirteenth century was carried to a successful conclusion .
But as recovery and prosperity progressed , enabling the population to reach its former levels in the late 15th and 16th centuries , the combination of both a newly-abundant labor supply as well as improved productivity , were ` mixed blessings ' for many segments of Western European society .
Despite tradition , landlords started the move to exclude peasants from `` common lands `` .
With trade stimulated , landowners increasingly moved away from the manorial economy .
Woollen manufacturing greatly expanded in France , Germany , and the Netherlands and new textile industries began to develop .
The invention of movable type would lead to the Protestant zeal for translating the Bible and getting it into the hands of the laity .
This would advance the culture of Biblical literacy .
The `` humanism '' of the Renaissance period stimulated unprecedented academic ferment , and a concern for academic freedom .
Ongoing , earnest theoretical debates occurred in the universities about the nature of the church , and the source and extent of the authority of the papacy , of councils , and of princes .
16th century
Luther 's 95 Theses
The protests against Rome began in earnest when Martin Luther , an Augustinian monk and professor at the university of Wittenberg , called in 1517 for a reopening of the debate on the sale of indulgences .
Luther 's dissent marked a sudden outbreak of a new and irresistible force of discontent which had been pushed underground but not resolved .
The quick spread of discontent occurred to a large degree because of the printing press and the resulting swift movement of both ideas and documents , including the 95 Theses .
Information was also widely disseminated in manuscript form , as well as by cheap prints and woodcuts amongst the poorer sections of society .
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Ulrich Zwingli .
These two movements quickly agreed on most issues , as the recently introduced printing press spread ideas rapidly from place to place , but some unresolved differences kept them separate .
Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative , and moved independently toward more radical positions , some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists .
Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism -LRB- cf. Erasmus -RRB- , sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants , or forming outside of the churches .
Ulrich Zwingli
After this first stage of the Reformation , following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere .
The Reformation foundations engaged with Augustinianism .
Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of Augustine of Hippo .
The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against Pelagianism , a heresy that they perceived in the Catholic Church of their day .
In the course of this religious upheaval , the Peasants ' War of 1524–1525 swept through the Bavarian , Thuringian and Swabian principalities , leaving scores of Catholics slaughtered at the hands of Protestant bands , including the Black Company of Florian Geier , a knight from Giebelstadt who joined the peasants in the general outrage against the Catholic hierarchy .
Even though Luther and Calvin had very similar theological teachings , the relationship between their followers turned quickly to conflict .
Frenchman Michel de Montaigne told a story of a Lutheran pastor who once claimed that he would rather celebrate the mass of Rome than participate in a Calvinist service .
The political separation of the Church of England from Rome under Henry VIII , beginning in 1529 and completed in 1536 , brought England alongside this broad Reformed movement .
However , religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe .
Reformers in the Church of England alternated , for centuries , between sympathies for Catholic traditions and Protestantism , progressively forging a stable compromise between adherence to ancient tradition and Protestantism , which is now sometimes called the via media .
Life of Martin Luther and the heroes of the Reformation
Martin Luther , John Calvin , and Ulrich Zwingli are considered Magisterial Reformers because their reform movements were supported by ruling authorities or `` magistrates '' .
Frederick the Wise not only supported Luther , who was a professor at the university he founded , but also protected him by hiding Luther in Wartburg Castle in Eisenach .
Zwingli and Calvin were supported by the city councils in Zurich and Geneva .
Since the term `` magister '' also means `` teacher '' , the Magisterial Reformation is also characterized by an emphasis on the authority of a teacher .
This is made evident in the prominence of Luther , Calvin , and Zwingli as leaders of the reform movements in their respective areas of ministry .
Because of their authority , they were often criticized by Radical Reformers as being too much like the Roman Popes .
For example , Radical Reformer Andreas Karlstadt referred to the Wittenberg theologians as the `` new papists '' .
Humanism to Protestantism
The frustrated reformism of the humanists , ushered in by the Renaissance , contributed to a growing impatience among reformers .
Erasmus and later figures like Martin Luther and Zwingli would emerge from this debate and eventually contribute to another major schism of Christendom .
The crisis of theology beginning with William of Ockham in the fourteenth century was occurring in conjunction with the new burgher discontent .
Since the breakdown of the philosophical foundations of scholasticism , the new nominalism did not bode well for an institutional church legitimized as an intermediary between man and God .
New thinking favored the notion that no religious doctrine can be supported by philosophical arguments , eroding the old alliance between reason and faith of the medieval period laid out by Thomas Aquinas .
Erasmus
The major individualistic reform movements that revolted against medieval scholasticism and the institutions that underpinned it were humanism , devotionalism , -LRB- see for example , the Brothers of the Common Life and Jan Standonck -RRB- and the observatine tradition .
In Germany , `` the modern way '' or devotionalism caught on in the universities , requiring a redefinition of God , who was no longer a rational governing principle but an arbitrary , unknowable will that can not be limited .
God was now a ruler , and religion would be more fervent and emotional .
Thus , the ensuing revival of Augustinian theology , stating that man can not be saved by his own efforts but only by the grace of God , would erode the legitimacy of the rigid institutions of the church meant to provide a channel for man to do good works and get into heaven .
Humanism , however , was more of an educational reform movement with origins in the Renaissance ` s revival of classical learning and thought .
A revolt against Aristotelian logic , it placed great emphasis on reforming individuals through eloquence as opposed to reason .
The European Renaissance laid the foundation for the Northern humanists in its reinforcement of the traditional use of Latin as the great unifying cultural language .
The polarization of the scholarly community in Germany over the Reuchlin -LRB- 1455–1522 -RRB- affair , attacked by the elite clergy for his study of Hebrew and Jewish texts , brought Luther fully in line with the humanist educational reforms who favored academic freedom .
At the same time , the impact of the Renaissance would soon backfire against traditional Catholicism , ushering in an age of reform and a repudiation of much of medieval Latin tradition .
Led by Erasmus , the humanists condemned various forms of corruption within the Church , forms of corruption that might not have been any more prevalent than during the medieval zenith of the church .
Erasmus held that true religion was a matter of inward devotion rather than outward symbols of ceremony and ritual .
Going back to ancient texts , scriptures , from this viewpoint the greatest culmination of the ancient tradition , are the guides to life .
Favoring moral reforms and de-emphasizing didactic ritual , Erasmus laid the groundwork for Luther .
Humanism 's intellectual anti-clericalism would profoundly influence Luther .
The increasingly well-educated middle sectors of Northern Germany , namely the educated community and city dwellers would turn to Luther 's rethinking of religion to conceptualize their discontent according to the cultural medium of the era .
The great rise of the burghers , the desire to run their new businesses free of institutional barriers or outmoded cultural practices , contributed to the appeal of humanist individualism .
To many , papal institutions were rigid , especially regarding their views on just price and usury .
In the North , burghers and monarchs were united in their frustration for not paying any taxes to the nation , but collecting taxes from subjects and sending the revenues disproportionately to the Pope in Italy .
These trends heightened demands for significant reform and revitalization along with anticlericalism .
New thinkers began noticing the divide between the priests and the flock .
The clergy , for instance , were not always well-educated .
Parish priests often did not know Latin and rural parishes often did not have great opportunities for theological education for many at the time .
Due to its large landholdings and institutional rigidity , a rigidity to which the excessively large ranks of the clergy contributed , many bishops studied law , not theology , being relegated to the role of property managers trained in administration .
While priests emphasized works of religiosity , the respectability of the church began diminishing , especially among well educated urbanites , and especially considering the recent strings of political humiliation , such as the apprehension of Pope Boniface VIII by Philip IV of France , the `` Babylonian Captivity '' , the Great Schism , and the failure of Conciliar reformism .
In a sense , the campaign by Pope Leo X to raise funds to rebuild St. Peter 's Basilica was too much of an excess by the secular Renaissance church , prompting high-pressure indulgences that rendered the clergy establishments even more disliked in the cities .
Luther borrowed from the humanists the sense of individualism , that each man can be his own priest -LRB- an attitude likely to find popular support considering the rapid rise of an educated urban middle class in the North -RRB- , and that the only true authority is the Bible , echoing the reformist zeal of the Conciliar movement and opening up the debate once again on limiting the authority of the Pope .
While his ideas called for the sharp redefinition of the dividing lines between the laity and the clergy , his ideas were still , by this point , reformist in nature .
Luther 's contention that the human will was incapable of following good , however , resulted in his rift with Erasmus finally distinguishing Lutheran reformism from humanism .
Lutheranism adopted by the German princes
Luther affirmed a theology of the Eucharist called Real Presence , a doctrine of the presence of Christ in the Eucharist which affirms the real presence yet upholding that the bread and wine are not `` changed '' into the body and blood ; rather the divine elements adhere `` in , with , and under '' the earthly elements .
He took this understanding of Christ 's presence in the Eucharist to be more harmonious with the Church 's teaching on the Incarnation .
Just as Christ is the union of the fully human and the fully divine -LRB- cf. Council of Chalcedon -RRB- so to the Eucharist is a union of Bread and Body , Wine and Blood .
According to the doctrine of real presence , the substances of the body and the blood of Christ and of the bread and the wine were held to coexist together in the consecrated Host during the communion service .
While Luther seemed to maintain the perpetual consecration of the elements , other Lutherans argued that any consecrated bread or wine left over would revert to its former state the moment the service ended .
Most Lutherans accept the latter .
Portrait of Philipp Melanchthon , by Lucas Cranach the Elder .
Oil on panel .
A Lutheran understanding of the Eucharist is distinct from the Reformed doctrine of the Eucharist in that Lutherans affirm a real , physical presence of Christ in the Eucharist -LRB- as opposed to either a `` spiritual presence '' or a `` memorial '' -RRB- and Lutherans affirm that the presence of Christ does not depend on the faith of the recipient ; the repentant receive Christ in the Eucharist worthily , the unrepentant who receive the Eucharist risk the wrath of Christ .
Luther , along with his colleague Philipp Melanchthon , emphasized this point in his plea for the Reformation at the Reichstag in 1529 amid charges of heresy .
But the changes he proposed were of such a fundamental nature that by their own logic they would automatically overthrow the old order ; neither the Emperor nor the Church could possibly accept them , as Luther well knew .
As was only to be expected , the edict by the Diet of Worms -LRB- 1521 -RRB- prohibited all innovations .
Meanwhile , in these efforts to retain the guise of a Catholic reformer as opposed to a heretical revolutionary , and to appeal to German princes with his religious condemnation of the peasant revolts backed up by the Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms , Luther 's growing conservatism would provoke more radical reformers .
At a religious conference with the Zwinglians in 1529 , Melanchthon joined with Luther in opposing a union with Zwingli .
There would finally be a schism in the reform movement due to Luther 's belief in real presence —the real -LRB- as opposed to symbolic -RRB- presence of Christ at the Eucharist .
His original intention was not schism , but with the Reichstag of Augsburg -LRB- 1530 -RRB- and its rejection of the Lutheran `` Augsburg Confession '' , a separate Lutheran church finally emerged .
In a sense , Luther would take theology further in its deviation from established Catholic dogma , forcing a rift between the humanist Erasmus and Luther .
Similarly , Zwingli would further repudiate ritualism , and break with the increasingly conservative Luther .
Reformation and Counter Reformation in Europe .
Protestant lands in blue , Catholic in olive
Aside from the enclosing of the lower classes , the middle sectors of northern Germany , namely the educated community and city dwellers , would turn to religion to conceptualize their discontent according to the cultural medium of the era .
The great rise of the burghers , the desire to run their new businesses free of institutional barriers or outmoded cultural practices contributed to the appeal of individualism .
To many , papal institutions were rigid , especially regarding their views on just price and usury .
In the North , burghers and monarchs were united in their frustration for not paying any taxes to the nation , but collecting taxes from subjects and sending the revenues disproportionately to Italy .
In northern Europe , Luther appealed to the growing national consciousness of the German states because he denounced the Pope for involvement in politics as well as religion .
Moreover , he backed the nobility , which was now justified to crush the Great Peasant Revolt of 1525 and to confiscate church property by Luther 's Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms .
This explains the attraction of some territorial princes to Lutheranism , especially its Doctrine of the Two Kingdoms .
However , the Elector of Brandenburg , Joachim I , blamed Lutheranism for the revolt and so did others .
In Brandenburg , it was only under his successor Joachim II that Lutheranism was established , and the old religion was not formally extinct in Brandenburg until the death of the last Catholic bishop there , Georg von Blumenthal , who was Bishop of Lebus and sovereign Prince-Bishop of Ratzeburg .
With the church subordinate to and the agent of civil authority and peasant rebellions condemned on strict religious terms , Lutheranism and German nationalist sentiment were ideally suited to coincide .
Though Charles V fought the Reformation , it is no coincidence either that the reign of his nationalistic predecessor Maximilian I saw the beginning of the movement .
While the centralized states of western Europe had reached accords with the Vatican permitting them to draw on the rich property of the church for government expenditures , enabling them to form state churches that were greatly autonomous of Rome , similar moves on behalf of the Reich were unsuccessful so long as princes and prince bishops fought reforms to drop the pretension of the secular universal empire .
The Reformation outside Germany
Switzerland
Zwingli
Ulrich Zwingli
Parallel to events in Germany , a movement began in Switzerland under the leadership of Huldrych Zwingli .
These two movements quickly agreed on most issues , as the recently introduced printing press spread ideas rapidly from place to place , but some unresolved differences kept them separate .
Some followers of Zwingli believed that the Reformation was too conservative , and moved independently toward more radical positions , some of which survive among modern day Anabaptists .
Other Protestant movements grew up along lines of mysticism or humanism -LRB- cf. Erasmus -RRB- , sometimes breaking from Rome or from the Protestants , or forming outside of the churches .
John Calvin
Following the excommunication of Luther and condemnation of the Reformation by the Pope , the work and writings of John Calvin were influential in establishing a loose consensus among various groups in Switzerland , Scotland , Hungary , Germany and elsewhere .
Geneva became the unofficial capital of the Protestant movement , led by the Frenchman , Jean Calvin , until his death -LRB- when Calvin 's ally , William Farel , assumed the spiritual leadership of the group -RRB- .
The Reformation foundations engaged with Augustinianism .
Both Luther and Calvin thought along lines linked with the theological teachings of Augustine of Hippo .
The Augustinianism of the Reformers struggled against Pelagianism , a heresy that they perceived in the Catholic Church of their day .
Ironically , even though both Luther and Calvin both had very similar theological teachings , the relationship between Lutherans and Calvinists evolved into one of conflict .
Scandinavia
All of Scandinavia ultimately adopted Lutheranism over the course of the sixteenth century , as the monarchs of Denmark -LRB- who also ruled Norway and Iceland -RRB- and Sweden -LRB- who also ruled Finland -RRB- converted to that faith .
In Sweden the Reformation was spearheaded by Gustav Vasa , elected king in 1523 .
Friction with the pope over the latter 's interference in Swedish ecclesiastical affairs led to the discontinuance of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy from 1523 .
Four years later , at the Diet of Västerås , the king succeeded in forcing the diet to accept his dominion over the national church .
The king was given possession of all church property , church appointments required royal approval , the clergy were subject to the civil law , and the `` pure Word of God '' was to be preached in the churches and taught in the schools—effectively granting official sanction to Lutheran ideas .
Under the reign of Frederick I -LRB- 1523–33 -RRB- , Denmark remained officially Catholic .
But though Frederick initially pledged to persecute Lutherans , he soon adopted a policy of protecting Lutheran preachers and reformers , of whom the most famous was Hans Tausen .
During his reign , Lutheranism made significant inroads among the Danish population .
Frederick 's son , Christian , was openly Lutheran , which prevented his election to the throne upon his father 's death .
However , following his victory in the civil war that followed , in 1537 he became Christian III and began a reformation of the official state church .
Although Denmark is officially reformed in the year 1536
England
Elizabeth I , Queen of England and Ireland .
Church of England
The separation of the Church of England -LRB- or Anglican Church -RRB- from Rome under Henry VIII , beginning in 1529 and completed in 1536 , brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement ; however , religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe .
Reformers in the Church of England alternated , for centuries , between sympathies for Catholic tradition and more reformed principles , gradually developing into a tradition which is considered a middle way -LRB- via media -RRB- between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions .
The English Reformation followed a different course from the Reformation in continental Europe .
There had long been a strong strain of anti-clericalism , and England had already given rise to the Lollard movement of John Wycliffe , which played an important part in inspiring the Hussites in Bohemia .
Lollardy was suppressed and became an underground movement so the extent of its influence in the 1520s is difficult to assess .
The different character of the English Reformation came rather from the fact that it was driven initially by the political necessities of Henry VIII .
Henry had once been a sincere Catholic and had even authored a book strongly criticizing Luther , but he later found it expedient and profitable to break with the Papacy .
His wife , Catherine of Aragon , bore him only a single child , Mary .
As England had recently gone through a lengthy dynastic conflict -LRB- see Wars of the Roses -RRB- , Henry feared that his lack of a male heir might jeopardize his descendants ' claim to the throne .
However , Pope Clement VII , concentrating more on Charles V 's `` sack of Rome '' , denied his request for an annulment .
Had Clement granted the annulment and therefore admitted that his predecessor , Julius II , had erred , Clement would have given support to the Lutheran assertion that Popes replaced their own judgement for the will of God .
King Henry decided to remove the Church of England from the authority of Rome .
In 1534 , the Act of Supremacy made Henry the Supreme Head of the Church of England .
Between 1535 and 1540 , under Thomas Cromwell , the policy known as the Dissolution of the Monasteries was put into effect .
The veneration of some saints , certain pilgrimages and some pilgrim shrines were also attacked .
Huge amounts of church land and property passed into the hands of the crown and ultimately into those of the nobility and gentry .
The vested interest thus created made for a powerful force in support of the dissolutions .
There were some notable opponents to the Henrician Reformation , such as Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher , who were executed for their opposition .
There was also a growing party of reformers who were imbued with the Zwinglian and Calvinistic doctrines now current on the Continent .
When Henry died he was succeeded by his Protestant son Edward VI , who , through his empowered councillors -LRB- with the King being only nine years old at his succession and not yet sixteen at his death -RRB- the Duke of Somerset and the Duke of Northumberland , ordered the destruction of images in churches , and the closing of the chantries .
Under Edward VI the reform of the Church of England was established unequivocally in doctrinal terms .
Yet , at a popular level , religion in England was still in a state of flux .
Following a brief Roman Catholic restoration during the reign of Mary 1553–1558 , a loose consensus developed during the reign of Elizabeth I , though this point is one of considerable debate among historians .
Yet it is the so-called `` Elizabethan Religious Settlement `` to which the origins of Anglicanism are traditionally ascribed .
The compromise was uneasy and was capable of veering between extreme Calvinism on the one hand and Catholicism on the other , but compared to the bloody and chaotic state of affairs in contemporary France , it was relatively successful until the Puritan Revolution or English Civil War in the seventeenth century .
Puritan movement
The success of the Counter-Reformation on the Continent and the growth of a Puritan party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarized the Elizabethan Age , although it was not until the 1640s that England underwent religious strife comparable to that which its neighbours had suffered some generations before .
The early Puritan movement -LRB- late 16th century-17th century -RRB- was Reformed or Calvinist and was a movement for reform in the Church of England .
Its origins lay in the discontent with the Elizabethan Religious Settlement .
The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe , especially Geneva .
The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as idolatrous -LRB- vestments , surplices , organs , genuflection -RRB- , which they castigated as `` popish pomp and rags '' .
-LRB- See Vestments controversy . -RRB-
They also objected to ecclesiastical courts .
They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the Book of Common Prayer ; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement .
The later Puritan movement were often referred to as Dissenters and Nonconformists and eventually led to the formation of various Reformed denominations .
The most famous and well-known emigration to America was the migration of the Puritan separatists from the Anglican Church of England , who fled first to Holland , and then later to America , to establish the English colonies of New England , which later became the United States .
These Puritan separatists were also known as `` the pilgrims `` .
After establishing a colony at Plymouth -LRB- in what would become later Massachusetts -RRB- in 1620 , the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the King of England which legitimized their colony , allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England , in accordance with the principles of mercantilism .
This successful , though initially quite difficult , colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America -LRB- the earlier French , Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Catholic -RRB- , and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and economic freedom , to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe -LRB- and later , from all over the world -RRB- fled to for peace , freedom and opportunity .
The original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism , which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the native American Indians and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas .
Scotland
The Reformation in Scotland 's case culminated ecclesiastically in the re-establishment of the church along Reformed lines , and politically in the triumph of English influence over that of France .
John Knox is regarded as the leader of the Scottish Reformation
The Reformation Parliament of 1560 , which repudiated the pope 's authority , forbade the celebration of the mass and approved a Protestant Confession of Faith , was made possible by a revolution against French hegemony under the regime of the regent Mary of Guise , who had governed Scotland in the name of her absent daughter Mary Queen of Scots -LRB- then also Queen of France -RRB- .
The Scottish Reformation decisively shaped the Church of Scotland and , through it , all other Presbyterian churches worldwide .
A spiritual revival also broke out among Catholics soon after Martin Luther 's actions , and led to the Scottish Covenanters ' movement , the precursor to Scottish Presbyterianism .
This movement spread , and greatly influenced the formation of Puritanism among the Anglican Church in England .
The Scottish Covenanters were persecuted by the Roman Catholic Church .
This persecution by the Catholics drove some of the Protestant Covenanter leadership out of Scotland , and into France and later , Switzerland .
France
Protestantism also spread into France , where the Protestants were nicknamed `` Huguenots `` , and this touched off decades of warfare in France , after initial support by Henry of Navarre was lost due to the `` Night of the Placards `` affair .
Many French Huguenots , however , still contributed to the Protestant movement , including many who emigrated to the English colonies .
Saint Bartholomew ` s Day massacre , Painting by François Dubois -LRB- born about 1529 , Amiens , Picardy -RRB-
Though he was not personally interested in religious reform , Francis I -LRB- 1515–47 -RRB- initially maintained an attitude of tolerance , arising from his interest in the humanist movement .
This changed in 1534 with the Affair of the Placards .
In this act , Protestants denounced the mass in placards that appeared across France , even reaching the royal apartments .
The issue of religious faith having been thrown into the arena of politics , Francis was prompted to view the movement as a threat to the kingdom 's stability .
This led to the first major phase of anti-Protestant persecution in France , in which the Chambre Ardente -LRB- `` Burning Chamber '' -RRB- was established within the Parlement of Paris to handle with the rise in prosecutions for heresy .
Several thousand French Protestants fled the country during this time , most notably John Calvin , who settled in Geneva .
Calvin continued to take an interest in the religious affairs of his native land and , from his base in Geneva , beyond the reach of the French king , regularly trained pastors to lead congregations in France .
Despite heavy persecution by Henry II , the Reformed Church of France , largely Calvinist in direction , made steady progress across large sections of the nation , in the urban bourgeoisie and parts of the aristocracy , appealing to people alienated by the obduracy and the complacency of the Catholic establishment .
French Protestantism , though its appeal increased under persecution , came to acquire a distinctly political character , made all the more obvious by the noble conversions of the 1550s .
This had the effect of creating the preconditions for a series of destructive and intermittent conflicts , known as the Wars of Religion .
The civil wars were helped along by the sudden death of Henry II in 1559 , which saw the beginning of a prolonged period of weakness for the French crown .
and outrage became the defining characteristic of the time , illustrated at its most intense in the St. Bartholomew 's Day massacre of August 1572 , when the Catholic Church annihilated between 30,000 and 100,000 Huguenots across France .
The wars only concluded when Henry IV , himself a former Huguenot , issued the Edict of Nantes , promising official toleration of the Protestant minority , but under highly restricted conditions .
Catholicism remained the official state religion , and the fortunes of French Protestants gradually declined over the next century , culminating in Louis XIV 's Edict of Fontainebleau —which revoked the Edict of Nantes and made Catholicism the sole legal religion of France .
In response to the Edict of Fontainebleau , Frederick William of Brandenburg declared the Edict of Potsdam , giving free passage to French Huguenot refugees , and tax-free status to them for 10 years .
Netherlands
The Reformation in the Netherlands , unlike in many other countries , was not initiated by the rulers of the Seventeen Provinces , but instead by multiple popular movements , which in turn were bolstered by the arrival of Protestant refugees from other parts of the continent .
While the Anabaptist movement enjoyed popularity in the region in the early decades of the Reformation , Calvinism , in the form of the Dutch Reformed Church , became the dominant Protestant faith in the country from the 1560s onward .
Harsh persecution of Protestants by the Spanish government of Phillip II contributed to a desire for independence in the provinces , which led to the Eighty Years ' War and eventually , the separation of the largely Protestant Dutch Republic from the Catholic-dominated Southern Netherlands -LRB- present-day Belgium -RRB- .
Hungary
Much of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary adopted Protestantism during the sixteenth century .
After the 1526 Battle of Mohács the Hungarian people were disillusioned by the ability of the government to protect them and turned to the faith which would infuse them with the strength necessary to resist the invader .
They found this in the teaching of the Protestant Reformers such as Luther .
The spread of Protestantism in the country was aided by its large ethnic German minority , which could understand and translate the writings of Martin Luther .
While Lutheranism gained a foothold among the German-speaking population , Calvinism became widely accepted among ethnic Hungarians .
In the more independent northwest the rulers and priests , protected now by the Habsburg Monarchy which had taken the field to fight the Turks , defended the old Catholic faith .
They dragged the Protestants to prison and the stake wherever they could .
Such strong measures only fanned the flames of protest , however .
Leaders of the Protestants included Matthias Biro Devai , Michael Sztarai , and Stephen Kis Szegedi .
Protestants likely formed a majority of Hungary 's population at the close of the sixteenth century , but Counter-Reformation efforts in the seventeenth century reconverted a majority of the kingdom to Catholicism .
A significant Protestant minority remained , most of it adhering to the Calvinist faith .
Conclusion and legacy
Although a Catholic clergyman himself , Cardinal Richelieu allied France with Protestant states .
The Reformation led to a series of religious wars that culminated in the Thirty Years ' War .
From 1618 to 1648 the Catholic House of Habsburg and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany , supported at various times by Denmark , Sweden and France .
The Habsburgs , who ruled Spain , Austria , the Spanish Netherlands and much of Germany and Italy , were staunch defenders of the Catholic Church .
Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Catholic France allied itself , first in secret and later on the battlefields , with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty .
For the first time since the days of Luther , political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe .
The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia , which ended the Thirty Years ' War , were :
All parties would now recognize the Peace of Augsburg of 1555 , by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state , the options being Catholicism , Lutheranism , and now Calvinism -LRB- the principle of cuius regio , eius religio -RRB-
Christians living in principalities where their denomination was not the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will .
The treaty also effectively ended the Pope 's pan-European political power .
Fully aware of the loss , Pope Innocent X declared the treaty `` null , void , invalid , iniquitous , unjust , damnable , reprobate , inane , empty of meaning and effect for all times . ''
European sovereigns , Catholic and Protestant alike , ignored his verdict .
